"""Deterministic rhetoric lint (anti-trope / banned-phrase / AI-tell scan).

Anvil's rubric dim 9 (*Rhetorical economy*) is judged by critics but was
never linted. This module adds a deterministic **rhetoric lint** to the
pre-flight family ("deterministic pre-flight before judgment" is a core
anvil principle): rule-set-driven phrase/trope/AI-tell scanning over body
markdown, producing **advisory** findings that downstream consumers (the
memo render gate's ``memo_rhetoric_lint`` dimension, issue #463) surface
as mechanical evidence for dim 9 scoring. Rhetoric rules have irreducible
false positives (quoted material, deliberate style), so this lint never
blocks: findings are warning severity at most, and the judgment call
stays with the dim 9 critics.

The rule-set SHAPE reimplements draftwell's ``packages/styleguide/``
named-rule-set model in pure stdlib Python (no TypeScript port). Four
rule kinds:

- ``phrase`` — a case-insensitive, word-boundary literal. Straight
  apostrophes in the pattern also match the typographic apostrophe
  (``'`` matches ``’``).
- ``regex`` — compiled as written, with ``re.IGNORECASE`` applied
  (the lint is a vocabulary check; casing never changes the verdict).
- ``frequency`` — a ``re.IGNORECASE`` pattern whose match count is
  measured per 1000 words of scanned text against
  ``max_per_1000_words``. A single-literal pattern behaves like a token
  count (e.g. the em-dash density rule: more than 8 ``—`` per 1000 words
  is the documented AI-tell); a span pattern counts spans (e.g. the
  ``emphasis-density`` rule counts ``\\*\\*[^*]+\\*\\*`` bold spans, more
  than ~20 per 1000 words being the bold-inflation tell). An optional
  ``label`` supplies a human name for the counted unit in the finding's
  diagnostic tail. A ``min_words`` floor (default
  :data:`DEFAULT_FREQUENCY_MIN_WORDS`) keeps density estimates from
  firing on statistically tiny texts.
- ``long_sentence`` — a syntactic-complexity sibling of ``frequency``
  (issue #750): naive sentence tokenization (split the scanned text on
  ``[.!?]`` followed by whitespace — the same fidelity the lint already
  accepts for word counts, so abbreviation noise like "Dr. Smith" is
  tolerated rather than specially handled) counts sentences whose word
  count exceeds ``sentence_word_threshold`` (default
  :data:`DEFAULT_LONG_SENTENCE_WORD_THRESHOLD`, 40 words), then measures
  that count per 1000 words against ``max_per_1000_words`` exactly like
  ``frequency``. This exists because de-hedging/de-bolding a revision
  can push qualifications out of markup (bold, parentheticals) and into
  syntax (absorbed clauses) — a pathology no markup-density rule can
  see. Deliberately **not** a mean-sentence-length cap: mean length is
  style, the pathology is the tail of multi-clause sentences a reader
  must re-parse, and the tail is what this rule measures. Shares
  ``min_words`` (the frequency floor) with the ``frequency`` kind.

JSON rule-set schema (consumer files)
-------------------------------------

Consumer rule files are JSON with this shape (identical to the dict
shape of :data:`DEFAULT_RHETORIC_RULES`, so this module is
self-documenting for consumer files)::

    {
      "name": "consumer-rules",
      "rules": [
        {"id": "no-delve", "kind": "phrase", "pattern": "delve",
         "message": "...", "severity": "warning"},
        {"id": "no-tapestry", "kind": "regex",
         "pattern": "\\\\btapestr(y|ies)\\\\b", "message": "..."},
        {"id": "no-opening-emdash", "kind": "regex", "scope": "first-line",
         "pattern": "[—–]", "message": "..."},
        {"id": "em-dash-density", "kind": "frequency", "pattern": "—",
         "max_per_1000_words": 8, "message": "..."},
        {"id": "long-sentence-density", "kind": "long_sentence",
         "sentence_word_threshold": 40, "max_per_1000_words": 4,
         "message": "..."}
      ],
      "disable": ["<default-rule-id>", "..."]
    }

Positional scope: ``phrase`` and ``regex`` rules accept an optional
``scope`` key. The default ``"body"`` evaluates the rule on every
non-excluded line (the original behavior). ``"first-line"`` restricts
the rule to the document's **first prose line** — the first non-blank
body line after skipping a leading YAML front-matter block and any
heading lines (layered on top of the fenced-code / comment / inline-code
exclusions). This makes document-positional tells expressible: e.g. the
``no-opening-emdash`` default fires on an em-dash in the opening line
regardless of overall density, but not on the same em-dash mid-document.
Unknown or absent ``scope`` coerces to ``"body"``. ``scope`` is
meaningless for ``frequency`` rules (frequency is always document-level)
and is not stored on them.

Merge semantics: consumer rules are appended to the framework defaults;
a consumer rule whose ``id`` collides with a default **replaces** it;
``disable`` switches off rules by id. ``severity`` defaults to
``"warning"``; consumers may downgrade to ``"info"`` but never upgrade
to ``"error"`` — an ``"error"`` (or any unknown severity) is coerced
back to ``"warning"`` because the dimension is advisory by contract.

Graceful degradation: malformed consumer JSON (unparseable file, or a
top-level shape that is not the documented object) produces a
defaults-only run plus ONE warning finding naming the parse error (the
``customer_context.py`` broken-declaration posture: a broken
declaration is surfaced, not silently ignored). An individually
malformed rule inside an otherwise valid file is skipped with a
warning finding naming the rule; the remaining rules still apply.

Scan exclusions
---------------

Fenced code blocks (``` / ~~~), HTML comments (including multi-line),
and inline code spans are excluded from the scan: code samples must not
fire the lint, and the suppression directive must not self-match.

Suppression
-----------

Per-line suppression follows the established ``anvil-lint-disable``
contract (marp_lint / memo_image_refs / render_gate): a directive of
the form ``<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_rhetoric_lint -->`` on the
same line as a hit, or on the line directly above it, downgrades that
line's phrase/regex hits to info findings (surfaced, not hidden).
Frequency findings are document-level (no line) and have no per-line
suppression surface; consumers tune or ``disable`` the rule instead.

Default rule set
----------------

:data:`DEFAULT_RHETORIC_RULES` is the in-module default set (the
``DEFAULT_PLACEHOLDER_PATTERNS`` precedent): ~25 conservative,
high-confidence AI-tells. Inclusion bar: the phrase must be (a) a
documented LLM-overuse marker and (b) rare in competent human
business/technical prose. Common discourse markers (``moreover``,
``furthermore``, ``however``) are explicitly excluded — too many false
positives on good prose.

Public API
----------

- ``lint_rhetoric(text, *, extra_rules=None, extra_rules_path=None)``
  → :class:`RhetoricLintResult` (mirrors ``marp_lint.LintResult``:
  findings list + ``to_json()``). Standalone-callable so review-phase
  commands and non-render_gate skills can adopt without the gate.
- ``DEFAULT_RHETORIC_RULES`` — the framework default rule set.

Pure stdlib (``re``, ``json``, ``dataclasses``, ``pathlib``) — no
pydantic, no third-party imports (issue #463 acceptance criterion).

    """Run the deterministic rhetoric lint over ``text``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text:
        Body markdown to scan. Fenced code blocks, HTML comments, and
        inline code spans are excluded (code samples must not fire;
        the suppression directive must not self-match).
    extra_rules:
        Optional in-memory consumer rules: either a bare list of rule
        dicts or the documented file shape (``{"name", "rules",
        "disable"}``). Merged over the defaults (id collision →
        consumer wins).
    extra_rules_path:
        Optional path to a consumer JSON rule file (same shape).
        Malformed input graceful-degrades to a defaults-only run with
        one warning finding naming the parse error. This is the
        integration point for the #461 voice contract's
        ``voice.rhetoric_rules`` sub-key, wired in issue #468:
        ``anvil.lib.project_brief.resolve_rhetoric_rules`` resolves
        the declared path and memo-render step 4g forwards it through
        ``render_gate.gate(kind="memo", rhetoric_rules_path=...)``
        (a missing declared file is forwarded too, so the OSError
        graceful-degrade above surfaces the broken declaration).
    suppress_rules:
        Directive tokens honored for per-line suppression. Defaults to
        :data:`DEFAULT_SUPPRESS_RULES` (the memo gate dimension name
        plus the generic ``rhetoric_lint`` token).

    Returns
    -------
    RhetoricLintResult
        ``findings`` (warning/info only — never error), ``words``
        (the per-1000-words denominator over the scanned text), and
