"""Typed parser for the project-level ``BRIEF.md`` (issue #285).

Sub-deliverable 2 of #283 — the **typed schema reader** that the rubric
overlay selector (#286) and cross-thread reference validator (#287)
build on. Sub-deliverable 1 of #283 (the project-root *discovery*
primitive, #284 / PR #290) ships at
``anvil/skills/memo/lib/project_discovery.py``. Discovery answers "where
is the thread root and which project owns it?"; this module answers
"given a confirmed project root, what does the BRIEF say?".

Single source of truth (issue #296)
-----------------------------------
Issue #296 (the project-org model lock, part B) **retires** the
sibling ``.anvil.json`` file and consolidates every project / per-doc
anvil-config knob into ``BRIEF.md``'s YAML frontmatter. Specifically,
the BRIEF schema now absorbs:

- Per-doc ``target_length`` (already present; the per-version
  override surface ``target_length_overrides`` is new — see
  :class:`BriefDocument`).
- Per-doc ``rubric_overrides`` (calibration suffix per PR #265 —
  formerly the ``rubric_overrides`` block at the top level of
  ``<thread>/.anvil.json``; see :class:`RubricOverrides`).
- :func:`body_filename_for` — the issue #295 slug-echo helper.

The ``anvil_config`` module is gone. Lifecycle commands, lib modules,
and tests that previously read ``<thread>/.anvil.json`` now read
``<project>/BRIEF.md`` via :func:`load_project_brief` (or the strict
variant) and look up the per-doc entry by slug
(``ProjectBrief.document_for_slug(slug)``). The
``rubric_overrides_suffix.py`` module that wires per-dim calibration
into the reviewer continues to operate against a typed
:class:`RubricOverrides` instance — the only change is that the
instance is now sourced from BRIEF.md rather than ``.anvil.json``.

Background — why this exists
----------------------------
The Studio canary surfaced a **project-as-thread-root** layout where a
single project-level ``BRIEF.md`` lives at the project root and
enumerates per-document metadata in its YAML frontmatter::

    <project>/
      BRIEF.md                 ← single project brief; documents: list +
                                  per-doc target_length, target_length_overrides,
                                  and rubric_overrides
      <slug-a>/
        <slug-a>.1/ ...
      <slug-b>/
        <slug-b>.1/ ...
      research/                ← shared evidence pool (already shipped, #281)

The project BRIEF frontmatter shape::

    ---
    project: brains-for-robots
    audience:
      - Sphere internal leadership (primary)
      - VC investors (secondary)
    hard_rules:
      - Avoid speculative claims without an evidence anchor.
      - Cite every number; cite every claim with a defensible mechanism.
    documents:
      - slug: investment-memo
        artifact_type: investment-memo
        target_length: { words: [8000, 11000] }
        target_length_overrides:
          "1": [8000, 11000]
          "2": [7500, 10500]
        rubric_overrides:
          memo_subtype: synthesis-brief
          dim_1_calibration: "decision-framework — score on framework clarity"
          dim_5_calibration: "defers to underlying market models"

    ---

    # Free-prose project shared context

This module reads that shape and surfaces it as a typed
:class:`ProjectBrief` with a per-document :class:`BriefDocument` list.

Public API
----------
``ArtifactType``
    Enum of registered artifact types. Unknown values raise a
    validation error listing the registered set — unless backed by a
    consumer overlay JSON (the #394 consumer extension tier; see
    "Artifact-type validation" below). Seed values per the curator's
    confirmation: ``investment-memo``, ``position-paper``,
    ``tactical-plan``, ``vision-document``, ``descriptive-thesis``.
    Issue #386 grew the set with skill-identity values ``deck``,
    ``slides``, ``proposal`` — for non-memo documents ``artifact_type``
    identifies which skill owns the thread rather than selecting a memo
    rubric overlay subtype. Issue #394 grew the memo-scoped subset with
    the canary-proven ``challenge-memo`` and ``strategy-memo`` genres.
    Issue #408 added the skill-identity value ``paper`` (registered as
    ``pub``, renamed under #694) (research-paper
    threads, the project-migrate BRIEF-synthesis registry gap).

``MEMO_ARTIFACT_TYPES``
    The memo-scoped subset of :class:`ArtifactType` — the registered
    values that select a shipped memo rubric overlay. Consumer-declared
    types (issue #394) are additionally memo-scoped by construction
    (their overlay JSONs live under the memo consumer registry).

``SKILL_IDENTITY_ARTIFACT_TYPES``
    The skill-identity subset of :class:`ArtifactType` (``deck`` /
    ``slides`` / ``proposal`` / ``paper``). Memo's overlay dispatch fails
    loudly for exactly this set (issue #386, re-keyed explicit under
    #394 so consumer-declared memo types don't trip the rejection).

``BriefDocument``
    Pydantic model for one entry in the ``documents:`` list. Carries
    ``slug``, ``artifact_type``, optional ``target_length``, optional
    ``target_length_overrides`` (per-version), and optional
    ``rubric_overrides`` (subtype calibration).

``TargetLengthRange``
    Word-count range. Used for both ``BriefDocument.target_length`` and
    the inner ``RubricOverrides.target_length``.

``TargetLengthOverrides``
    Per-version override map. Keys are version numbers (as strings:
    ``"1"``, ``"2"``, …); values are
    ``[min_words, max_words]`` ranges. Mirrors the historical
    ``.anvil.json`` ``target_length.overrides`` shape but lifted to the
    per-doc surface.

``RubricOverrides``
    Pydantic model holding the parsed per-doc ``rubric_overrides``
    block. Optional fields default to ``None`` so callers can check
    presence with ``is not None`` rather than a sentinel string.

``CalibrationOverride``
    Per-dimension override: holds the dimension number (1-9) and the
    calibration prose. Returned by ``RubricOverrides.calibrations``.

``WaiverOverride``
    Per-dimension waiver (issue #393): holds the dimension number (1-9)
    and the mandatory operator rationale (rationale-as-value on disk:
    ``dim_6_waiver: "<why>"``). Returned by ``RubricOverrides.waivers``.
    A waived dimension is removed from both the numerator and the
    denominator at verdict time; critical flags are NOT waivable.

``ProjectBrief``
    Pydantic model for the parsed BRIEF. Carries ``project``,
    ``audience``, ``hard_rules``, and ``documents``.

``load_project_brief(project_dir: Path) -> Optional[ProjectBrief]``
    Lenient loader. Returns ``None`` when ``<project_dir>/BRIEF.md``
    does not exist, has no YAML frontmatter, or its frontmatter is
    malformed. Raises ``ValueError`` for schema violations (the BRIEF
    is present but structurally wrong — a typo in ``artifact_type``,
    a duplicate slug, etc.).

``load_project_brief_strict(project_dir: Path) -> ProjectBrief``
    Strict loader. Raises ``FileNotFoundError`` when the BRIEF is
    missing, ``ValueError`` when frontmatter is missing or malformed,
    and propagates the same schema-violation ``ValueError`` as the
    lenient form.

``load_rubric_overrides_for_slug(project_dir: Path, slug: str) ->``
``RubricOverrides``
    Convenience wrapper: read the BRIEF, look up the document by
    ``slug``, and return its ``rubric_overrides`` block (or an empty
    :class:`RubricOverrides` when absent / malformed). This is the
    replacement for the retired
    ``anvil_config.load_rubric_overrides(thread_dir)`` API. The
    contract — empty instance on every absence path, never raise —
    mirrors the prior lenient form exactly.

``VoiceDocs`` / ``ResolvedVoiceDoc`` / ``resolve_voice_docs``
    The voice/persona grounding-docs contract (issue #461). The
    optional top-level ``voice:`` BRIEF block declares up to four
    voice artifacts (``style_guide`` / ``vocabulary`` / ``values`` /
    ``corpus`` glob); ``resolve_voice_docs(project_dir,
    consumer_root=None)`` resolves them project-root-first then
    consumer-root (never raising on absence — missing files come back
    as structured ``missing: true`` entries). Absent block →
    byte-identical behavior. See
    ``anvil/lib/snippets/voice_grounding.md`` for the drafter /
    reviewer role contracts.

``SubjectVoiceEntry`` / ``ResolvedSubjectVoice`` / ``resolve_subject_voice_docs``
    The **subject voice tier** (issue #598) — the parallel, independently
    activated tier for third-party dialogue grounded in a spoken corpus
    (interview transcripts) rather than the author's published prose. The
    optional ``voice.subjects`` list declares one entry per speaker
    (``name`` + ``corpus`` glob + optional ``voice_doc``);
    ``resolve_subject_voice_docs(project_dir, consumer_root=None)``
    resolves each with the same project-root-first, consumer-root-fallback
    walk and the same never-raise, structured ``missing: true`` posture.
    The subject tier and the author tier activate independently — a
    subjects-only block keeps ``VoiceDocs.is_empty == True``. See the
    ``voice_grounding.md`` §"Subject voice tier".

``body_filename_for(slug: str) -> str``
    Return the body markdown filename for a thread (``f"{slug}.md"``).
    Issue #295's slug-echo convention; the only recognized shape. Lives
    here because it's a one-line helper and ``project_brief.py`` is the
    project-config schema-of-record after the #296 consolidation.

Slug-directory divergence (Open Question #1 resolution)
-------------------------------------------------------
Both loaders accept an optional ``validate_dirs: bool = False`` flag. When
``True``, after parsing the BRIEF the loader walks ``<project_dir>`` for
slug-shaped subdirectories and applies the curator-confirmed asymmetric
rule:

- **Listed-but-missing** (BRIEF entry has no matching ``<project>/<slug>/``
  directory) → **warn but proceed**. A draft hasn't been started yet —
  common case. Surfaced via ``warnings.warn(UserWarning)``; the returned
  ``ProjectBrief`` is unchanged.
- **On-disk-but-unlisted** (``<project>/<slug>/`` exists with version
  dirs but no ``documents:`` entry names it) → **hard error**.
  Configuration drift — load-bearing. The reviewer can't pick a rubric
  overlay for a slug the BRIEF doesn't acknowledge. Raised as
  ``ValueError`` with the offending slug names.

When ``validate_dirs=False`` (default) the divergence check is skipped
entirely. Lifecycle commands that already know which slug they're
operating on (e.g., the reviewer with a thread root in hand) can opt into
the check; pure parser consumers don't need to.

Artifact-type validation (Open Question #5 resolution; two-tier per #394)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Closed-ended with a consumer extension tier.** Unknown
``artifact_type`` values raise a clear ``ValueError`` listing the
registered set (and any discovered consumer-declared types). This
prevents typos silently degrading to no-overlay behavior. The
registered values are :data:`REGISTERED_ARTIFACT_TYPES`. Two kinds of
registered value coexist (#386):

- **Memo overlay subtypes** (the seven memo-scoped values): adding one
  requires a code change here, membership in
  :data:`MEMO_ARTIFACT_TYPES`, AND a matching overlay JSON in the memo
  skill's ``rubric_overlays/`` registry (#286).
- **Skill-identity values** (``deck``, ``slides``, ``proposal`` —
  enumerated in :data:`SKILL_IDENTITY_ARTIFACT_TYPES`): identify which
  non-memo skill owns the thread. Adding one requires a code change
  here plus SKILL.md documentation in the owning skill — and it must be
  left OUT of :data:`MEMO_ARTIFACT_TYPES` (no memo overlay JSON; memo
  commands fail loudly on these types).

Issue #394 adds a **second validation tier**: an unregistered
``artifact_type`` is accepted IFF a consumer overlay JSON exists at
``<consumer>/.anvil/skills/memo/rubric_overlays/<type>.json``, where
``<consumer>`` is the directory carrying the ``.anvil/`` install marker
(located via :func:`anvil.lib.theme.find_consumer_root`, the same walk
the theme catalog and the paper skill's consumer venue-rubric tier use).
This lets a consumer register memo genres without a framework PR while
keeping the enum honest — an unknown type with NO consumer overlay
still fails loudly at parse time. Consumer-declared values are carried
as validated plain ``str`` on :class:`BriefDocument` (str-enum members
and plain strings interoperate for equality, hashing, and frozenset
membership, so downstream ``in MEMO_ARTIFACT_TYPES`` checks keep
working). The loaders compute the consumer-types set once per parse;
an explicit ``consumer_root`` parameter override keeps the parser
testable from tmp dirs (source-tree runs without a ``.anvil/`` ancestor
simply skip the consumer tier).

Validation discipline — BRIEF-side is STRICT
--------------------------------------------
The BRIEF parser is intentionally STRICT on schema violations (raises
``ValueError`` with field path + suggested fix). Per-doc metadata is
load-bearing for overlay selection in #286, so a malformed entry must
fail loudly rather than degrading silently. This is the opposite of the
prior ``anvil_config.py`` ``rubric_overrides`` loader, which was
**lenient** (warned + dropped fields) because ``.anvil.json`` was
optional config and the lenient form preserved zero-impact backwards
compat for threads without overrides.

The consolidation under #296 keeps both contracts intact by routing them
to two different entry points:

- :func:`load_project_brief` (and strict variant): full BRIEF parser,
  STRICT on every field.
- :func:`load_rubric_overrides_for_slug`: convenience wrapper, returns
  an empty :class:`RubricOverrides` on every absence path (missing
  BRIEF, missing document, missing ``rubric_overrides`` block).
  Mirrors the prior lenient ``anvil_config.load_rubric_overrides``
  surface exactly.

No new Python deps
------------------
YAML frontmatter parsing uses ``yaml.safe_load`` (``pyyaml`` is a declared
base dep — fix #268). Validation uses ``pydantic`` (declared base dep). No
new dependencies are introduced.

Skill-local first
-----------------
Lives under ``anvil/skills/memo/lib/`` per the CLAUDE.md "skill-local
first, lib promotion later" pattern. Promotion to ``anvil/lib/`` is queued
for the second-consumer trigger (likely ``anvil:proposal`` if it adopts
the project-BRIEF shape, or ``anvil:paper``).

Relationship to ``project_discovery.py``
----------------------------------------
The discovery primitive (#284) hands back a ``DiscoveryResult`` whose
``project_root`` field is the directory this module's loaders take as
input. The shared on-disk constants — ``BRIEF_FILENAME`` and
``DOCUMENTS_FRONTMATTER_KEY`` — are re-imported from
``project_discovery`` so a rename there propagates here automatically.

    Members
    -------
    INVESTMENT_MEMO
        The default memo shape. Calibrated for ranked-recommendation
        invest / pass / conditional decisions with a check size.
    POSITION_PAPER
        Argumentative case for a specific viewpoint (e.g., the canary's
        "latency wall" thesis).
    TACTICAL_PLAN
        Execution plan with prioritized actions and ownership.
    VISION_DOCUMENT
        Long-horizon technical or strategic vision.
    DESCRIPTIVE_THESIS
        Descriptive case for a team / market / shape (e.g., the canary's
        "team thesis").
    CHALLENGE_MEMO
        Tests a NAMED positioning thesis against evidence and delivers
        a verdict on the test (holds / breaks / holds-with-amendments)
        rather than an invest / pass / check-size decision. Registered
        under #394 from the canary's ``broadcom-thesis`` /
        ``sensor-stack`` threads.
    STRATEGY_MEMO
        Internal playbook (e.g., a fundraising strategy): the
        recommendation is the actionability of the play; financial
        scoring targets the soundness of the anchors the play leans on
        rather than venture-style unit economics. Registered under
        #394 from the canary's ``fundraising-strategy`` thread.
    DECK
        Skill-identity value (#386): an ``anvil:deck`` pitch-deck thread.
        Not a memo subtype — selects no memo rubric overlay.
    SLIDES
        Skill-identity value (#386): an ``anvil:slides`` talk-deck
        thread. Not a memo subtype — selects no memo rubric overlay.
    PROPOSAL
        Skill-identity value (#386): an ``anvil:proposal`` LaTeX
        customer-proposal thread. Not a memo subtype — selects no memo
        rubric overlay.
    PAPER
        Skill-identity value (#408; skill renamed ``pub`` → ``paper``
        under #694): an ``anvil:paper`` LaTeX research-paper thread. Not
        a memo subtype — selects no memo rubric overlay. Registered so
        project-migrate's BRIEF synthesis can name paper-class
        ``.tex``-bodied threads instead of silently defaulting them to
        ``investment-memo``. The legacy string ``pub`` is accepted as an
        input alias (see ``_ARTIFACT_TYPE_INPUT_ALIASES``) so pre-rename
        consumer BRIEFs keep parsing.
    REPORT
        Skill-identity value (#432): an ``anvil:report`` technical /
        customer-facing report thread. Not a memo subtype — selects no
        memo rubric overlay. Registered so project-migrate's vN
        report-dir adoption (``--adopt-vn``) can name the adopted
        thread's owning skill instead of silently defaulting to
        ``investment-memo`` (the same registry-gap shape #408 closed
        for ``paper``).
    IP_USPTO
        Skill-identity value (#440): an ``anvil:ip-uspto`` USPTO
        non-provisional patent-application thread. Not a memo subtype —
        selects no memo rubric overlay. Registered so project-migrate's
        letter-family adoption (``--adopt-family``) can record the
        operator's REQUIRED ``--artifact-type`` choice and survive
        strict post-write BRIEF validation (the #432 ``report``
        precedent).
    IP_USPTO_PROVISIONAL
        Skill-identity value (#440): an ``anvil:ip-uspto-provisional``
        USPTO provisional-application thread (claims-optional,
        enablement-depth-first — the conversion seed for
        ``anvil:ip-uspto``). Not a memo subtype — selects no memo
        rubric overlay. Registered alongside ``ip-uspto`` because
        there is no safe inference between a full application and a
        provisional — ``--adopt-family`` REQUIRES the operator to name
        one explicitly.
    ESSAY
        Skill-identity value (#460): an ``anvil:essay`` short-form
        voice-grounded essay / blog-post thread (markdown-only body,
        READY-terminal with a consumer-native publish handoff). Not a
        memo subtype — selects no memo rubric overlay. Registered per
        the #439/#457 precedent so a shared project BRIEF can declare
        which skill owns an essay thread.
    DATASHEET
        Skill-identity value (#486): an ``anvil:datasheet`` customer-facing
        IC / component datasheet thread (LaTeX ``datasheet.tex`` body). Not
        a memo subtype — selects no memo rubric overlay. The skill shipped
        (#418/#421) before this registry pattern was consistently applied;
        registered here so a validated BRIEF can carry
        ``artifact_type: datasheet`` and rubric-rebackport's BRIEF-route
        inference (#484) resolves an unstamped datasheet review to the
        ``("datasheet", 44)`` KNOWN_RUBRICS row.
    PRIMER
        Skill-identity value (#686): an ``anvil:primer`` long-form
        pedagogical explainer thread (a teach-from-intuition companion to
        a formal spec; markdown source-of-truth with an optional PDF
        render). Not a memo subtype — selects no memo rubric overlay.
        Registered per the #386/#408/#432/#440/#460 precedent so a shared
        project BRIEF can declare which skill owns a primer thread, and so
        the optional ``spec_ref`` companion-input key parses under the
        STRICT unknown-key rejection.
    SPEC
        Skill-identity value (#697/#706): an ``anvil:spec`` normative
        technical-specification thread (a protocol/wire-format/consensus
        spec maintained truthfully against its implementation; LaTeX
        source-of-truth with an optional PDF render). Not a memo subtype —
        selects no memo rubric overlay. Registered per the
        #386/#408/#432/#440/#460/#686 precedent so a shared project BRIEF
        can declare which skill owns a spec thread, and so the optional
        ``code_ref`` companion-input key (the mirror image of primer's
        ``spec_ref`` — the implementation the spec normatively describes)
        parses under the STRICT unknown-key rejection.
    MEMOIR
        Skill-identity value (#740): an ``anvil:memoir`` chaptered
        narrative-nonfiction thread reconstructed from a private
        evidentiary corpus (family memoirs, oral histories,
        biography-from-archive). Not a memo subtype — selects no memo

    ``target_length.overrides.v1`` / ``v2`` / …; the BRIEF-side shape is
    a bare-integer-string key per entry because YAML mappings carry no
    natural ``v`` prefix. Authors who want to be explicit can quote the
    key (``"1"``) — the YAML parser collapses ``1`` and ``"1"`` to the
    same string anyway.

    Example::

        target_length_overrides:

    The **subject voice tier** grounds a third party's rendered dialogue
    in that person's *spoken* corpus (interview transcripts) — as opposed
    to the author-persona tier (:class:`VoiceDocs`), which grounds the
    author's prose in their *published* exemplars. A memoir reconstructing
    a grandmother's dialogue, a case study quoting a customer, an
    oral-history project — anywhere a real person's speech is rendered
    from recorded source.

    name
        Speaker identifier used in review findings and the

        non-empty.
    corpus
        Glob (project-root-first, consumer-root fallback — same semantics
        as the author :attr:`VoiceDocs.corpus`) selecting the transcript
        files that are this speaker's spoken ground truth. Required,
        non-empty. Resolved by :func:`resolve_subject_voice_docs`; a glob
        matching zero files comes back ``missing: true`` (a defect to
        surface, not a crash).
    voice_doc
        Optional path to a markdown doc documenting this speaker's cadence
        rules, characteristic openers, and named failure modes (e.g.
        "an em-dash inside a spoken line is a strong drift signal; balanced
        multi-clause sentences are polish creep"). Corpus alone is
        sufficient to activate the entry — ``voice_doc`` is a refinement,

class VoiceDocs(BaseModel):
    """Parsed optional top-level ``voice:`` block (issue #461).

    The voice/persona grounding-docs contract: a project declares up to
    four voice artifacts that ground the drafter's register and the
    reviewer's voice-fidelity calibration (see
    ``anvil/lib/snippets/voice_grounding.md`` for the role contracts).

    On-disk shape (every sub-key optional; the block itself optional)::

        voice:
          style_guide: STYLE_GUIDE.md        # register / cadence rules
          vocabulary: VOCABULARY.md          # AI-tell guidance (judgment side)
          values: VALUES.md                  # stances / anti-stances / standing
          corpus: writing-corpus/**/*.md     # published exemplars (glob)
          rhetoric_rules: rhetoric-rules.json  # consumer lint rules (gate side)

    **No ``voice:`` block → byte-identical behavior** (the #428/#452
    activation pattern). Declared paths resolve **project-root first,
    then consumer-root** via :func:`resolve_voice_docs` — voice docs
    are usually persona-level repo-root artifacts shared across
    projects, but a project ghostwriting in a different persona can
    shadow them locally.

    File existence is NOT validated at parse time (environment, not
    schema). A declared-but-missing file ACTIVATES the tier and
    surfaces as a ``major`` review finding — "a broken declaration is
    a defect to surface, not an opt-out" (the
    ``report/lib/customer_context.py`` posture).

    **``rhetoric_rules`` is the asymmetric fifth sub-key** (issue
    #468): a path to a consumer **JSON rule file** consumed by the
    render gate's advisory ``memo_rhetoric_lint`` check (issue #463),
    NOT a markdown grounding doc for the drafter/reviewer loop. It
    never joins :data:`VOICE_DOC_KINDS`, is excluded from
    :func:`resolve_voice_docs` output, and does NOT count toward
    :attr:`is_empty` — a ``rhetoric_rules``-only block activates ONLY
    the lint wiring (via :func:`resolve_rhetoric_rules`), never the
    voice-grounding judgment tier.

    Unknown sub-keys are **preserved verbatim** under ``unknown_keys``
    (lenient inner-block posture, same as
    ``RubricOverrides.unknown_keys``) so a forward-shipped sub-key
    can land in BRIEF.md ahead of loader support without
    breaking existing consumers. The loader warns via
    ``warnings.warn`` so the typo case stays visible.

    slug
        Document slug. Names the sibling directory under the project
        root (``<project>/<slug>/``) that holds the document's version
        dirs. Required, non-empty, must contain only filesystem-safe
        characters (alphanumerics, hyphens, underscores) — the on-disk
        directory naming convention.
    artifact_type
        Registered artifact type (an :class:`ArtifactType` member) or a
        consumer-declared type (a validated plain ``str`` backed by a
        consumer overlay JSON — issue #394). Drives rubric overlay
        selection in sub-deliverable 3 (#286). Validated two-tier

        consumer overlay registry — values in neither tier raise a
        clear error listing both sets and the consumer-overlay
        extension path. Never a free string. Registered values are
        normalized to enum members; consumer values stay plain strings
        (str-enum members and plain strings interoperate for equality
        / hashing, so membership checks against
        :data:`MEMO_ARTIFACT_TYPES` work uniformly).
    target_length
        Optional word-count range for this document. When set, the
        drafter / reviser's resolution helper uses it as the document-
        level length target. When absent, the resolver falls back to
        the rubric overlay's default range.
    target_length_overrides
        Optional per-version overrides on top of ``target_length``. Each
        key is a version-number string (e.g., ``"1"``); each value is a
        ``[min, max]`` range. Mirrors the historical
        ``.anvil.json target_length.overrides`` shape (issue #296
        consolidation moved it here).
    rubric_overrides
        Optional :class:`RubricOverrides` block — subtype calibration
        per PR #265 (issue #233). Mirrors the historical
        ``.anvil.json rubric_overrides`` shape (issue #296
        consolidation moved it here).
    render_engine
        Optional per-document override for the memo HTML/PDF engine
        used by ``anvil/lib/render_gate.py``. One of
        ``"weasyprint"``, ``"xelatex"``, or ``"wkhtmltopdf"`` (issue
        #320). When set, ``_select_memo_engine`` honors this request
        if the named binary is on PATH; otherwise it gracefully
        falls through to the existing
        ``weasyprint > wkhtmltopdf > xelatex`` auto-priority. The
        theme-level default knob shipped by parallel issue #322 sits
        *below* this per-doc value in precedence (per-thread >
        per-project > per-theme > framework default).
    render_template
        Optional per-document consumer-owned pandoc template (issue
        #391). A path string — resolved relative to the directory
        containing ``BRIEF.md`` (the project root) at render time;
        absolute paths are accepted and used as-is. When set, the memo
        render chain passes ``--template <resolved-path>`` to pandoc
        *instead of* the theme/framework template, **iff** the template
        extension matches the dispatched engine chain (``.tex`` /
        ``.latex`` on the ``xelatex`` chain; ``.html`` / ``.htm`` on the
        ``weasyprint`` / ``wkhtmltopdf`` chain). On extension/engine
        mismatch or a missing file, the consumer template is skipped
        with a breadcrumb in ``render_gate.reasons`` and the existing
        resolver chain (theme > framework default) applies — the
        #347-style silent-with-record skip. Precedence: per-doc
        ``render_template`` > theme-resolved template > framework
        default, consistent with the documented
        ``per-thread > per-project > per-theme > framework`` ordering.

        Parse-time validation enforces type only (non-empty string;
        whitespace-only normalizes to ``None``). File existence is a
        render-time concern — BRIEF parsing must not depend on cwd.
    render_lua_filters
        Optional per-document list of pandoc Lua filter paths (issue
        #391). Each entry is resolved like :attr:`render_template`
        (BRIEF-relative or absolute). Engine-agnostic — Lua filters act
        on pandoc's front-end and are valid on every chain; each
        resolved filter is passed as ``--lua-filter <path>`` in
        declaration order. A missing filter file is skipped with a
        breadcrumb in ``render_gate.reasons``; the remaining filters
        still apply. Empty list normalizes to ``None``.
    render_metadata
        Optional per-document map of pandoc metadata entries (issue
        #391). Each ``key: value`` pair becomes one ``-M key=value``
        flag. Values must be scalars (str / int / float / bool) and are
        coerced to strings at parse time (bools to ``"true"`` /
        ``"false"``). Engine-agnostic — always passed when set.

        One recognized token: a literal ``{N}`` in a metadata *value*
        is replaced with the version number (parsed from the
        ``<slug>.{N}`` version-dir name) at render time — e.g.,
        ``doc-version: "Draft v{N}"`` renders as ``Draft v7`` for
        ``<slug>.7/``. No other tokens are recognized; other brace text
        passes through verbatim. Empty map normalizes to ``None``.

        Example (the studio canary's branded-bundle shape)::

            documents:
              - slug: investment-memo
                render_engine: xelatex
                render_template: sphere-memo-template.tex
                render_lua_filters: [strip-alt.lua]
                render_metadata:
                  doc-type: "Investment Memo"
                  doc-version: "Draft v{N}"
    latex_header_includes
        Optional per-document preamble extension threaded into pandoc's
        ``header-includes`` slot when the dispatched engine is
        ``xelatex`` (issue #347). Free-form LaTeX text. Used to load
        consumer-specific packages (e.g., ``xcolor``, ``tabularx``) or
        define named colors / custom environments referenced by
        ``{=latex}`` raw blocks in the memo body, *without* requiring
        the operator to maintain a full ``template.tex`` override.

        Engine-scoped by name: pandoc's ``header-includes`` metadata is
        also honored by the HTML chain (``template.html`` has the same
        ``$for(header-includes)$`` slot), so a generic
        ``header_includes`` could surprise an operator who flips
        ``render_engine`` between ``xelatex`` and ``weasyprint``. The
        explicit ``latex_`` prefix makes it visible that the contents
        are xelatex-only — when the dispatched engine is *not*
        xelatex, ``_render_memo_source`` silently skips the include
        and records the skip in the gate's ``reasons`` audit trail.

        The contents are opaque to the parser: any string survives the
        validator. Empty / whitespace-only values are normalized to
        ``None`` so a YAML author can write ``latex_header_includes:``
        with nothing on the right-hand side and get back-compat
        behavior.

        Example (a table-dense memo using ``{=latex}`` blocks)::

            latex_header_includes: |
              \\usepackage{xcolor}
              \\definecolor{green}{HTML}{059669}
              \\definecolor{ink}{HTML}{0f172a}
              \\usepackage{tabularx}
              \\newcolumntype{Y}{>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}X}
    max_iterations
        Optional paired-override of the default iteration cap
        (:data:`DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS` = 4) for the review/revise loop
        on this thread (issue #349). When set, the override **may raise
        but not lower** the principled default — values below
        :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_ITERATIONS` are treated as malformed and
        rejected at parse time.

        The override is **paired** with :attr:`iteration_cap_rationale`:
        both keys must be present and well-formed for the override to
        take effect. Setting :attr:`max_iterations` without a non-empty
        :attr:`iteration_cap_rationale` (or vice-versa) is a schema
        violation — the BRIEF parser raises ``ValueError`` with the
        offending field path so the operator can correct the BRIEF
        before any drafter / reviser pass picks up an unjustified
        override.

        The paired-override design mirrors the deck skill's
        ``<thread>/.anvil.json`` contract documented at
        ``anvil/skills/deck/SKILL.md`` §"Per-thread override contract".
        The deck override lives in ``.anvil.json`` (the per-thread
        carrier predating the #296 consolidation); the memo override
        lives here in the project BRIEF (the post-#296 single-source-
        of-truth carrier).

        Semantics are **sticky raise**, NOT single-use: setting
        ``max_iterations: 5`` raises the cap to 5 until the BRIEF is
        edited again. The required rationale — not single-use semantics
        — is what prevents abuse.

        Drafter and reviser commands mirror the resolved value into
        per-version ``_progress.json.metadata.max_iterations`` and
        ``_progress.json.metadata.iteration_cap_rationale`` so each
        version dir carries an audit trail of the cap in effect when it
        was produced. The reviser's BLOCKED notice (see
        ``commands/memo-revise.md`` §"BLOCKED notice") surfaces the
        rationale verbatim when the elevated cap is hit, so the operator
        sees the prior authorization at the moment they need it.
    iteration_cap_rationale
        Required-when-:attr:`max_iterations`-is-set free-prose
        justification for the elevated cap (issue #349). When set,
        documents *why* this thread deserves more revision passes than
        the principled default. The rationale text is what makes the
        override principled and is preserved in BRIEF git history as the
        audit trail.

        Whitespace-only values are normalized to ``None`` at parse time
        — a YAML author can write ``iteration_cap_rationale:`` with
        nothing on the right-hand side, but that field will not
        activate an override (the parser will raise because the paired
        :attr:`max_iterations` is then set without a valid rationale).

        Example (a memo thread surfacing the cap-bound near-miss
        documented in issue #349)::

            documents:
              - slug: aldus
                artifact_type: investment-memo
                max_iterations: 5
                iteration_cap_rationale: |
                  Operator-extended to 5 on 2026-06-08. Reason: v4 verdict
                  34/44 vs floor 35, gap is design-side (slide 7 figsize +
                  slide 4 preamble drop), reviewer identified memo-revise
                  can close it; founder follow-ups for source-side lift
                  (Dims 3/5/6) are tracked separately at issue X.
    web_search
        Optional consumer-opt-in autonomous web literature search for
        the ``paper`` skill's ``paper-litsearch`` / ``paper-review`` commands
        (issue #424). Strict bool: ``true`` enables web search; absent /
        ``false`` / ``None`` are all equivalent and leave the commands
        byte-identical to their default no-web behavior. Non-bool
        values (including YAML strings like ``"true"`` and the integers
        ``0``/``1``) are rejected at parse time with a field-path
        message — a silently-coerced truthy string must not flip an
        anti-hallucination posture.

        The per-thread ``<thread>/BRIEF.md`` frontmatter is the primary
        carrier of this knob (search appetite is per-paper); this
        document-entry key is the post-#295 project-model equivalent so
        a project BRIEF declaring the knob does not trip the STRICT
        unknown-key rejection. Every web-discovered citation must still
        pass the resolver-verified-or-dropped contract via
        ``anvil/lib/cite.py::resolve()`` — see
        ``anvil/skills/paper/commands/paper-litsearch.md``.

        Example::

            documents:
              - slug: q3-method
                artifact_type: paper
                web_search: true
    spec_ref
        Optional companion-input path/glob for the ``anvil:primer`` skill
        (issue #686): the formal sibling artifact (a whitepaper, spec,
        standard, or API doc) that a primer teaches *alongside*. Resolved
        project-root-first then consumer-root by
        :func:`resolve_spec_ref` — the same walk the ``voice:`` docs and
        ``report``'s ``prior_reports[]`` use. ``primer-audit`` reads the
        resolved document as its spec-consistency oracle (the
        "Contradicts cited spec" critical flag); ``primer-review`` reads
        it for the "Duplicates formal spec section" critical flag.

        Type-and-emptiness only at parse time (non-empty string;
        whitespace-only normalizes to ``None``) — file existence is a
        resolution-time concern (BRIEF parsing must not depend on cwd).
        The activation contract lives in ``anvil/skills/primer/SKILL.md``
        §"Spec-ref contract": **absent** → the spec-consistency tier is
        silent/off and both critics record a ``major`` finding
        recommending the operator declare it; **declared-but-missing** →
        the tier activates but degrades gracefully (a ``major`` finding,
        never a crash, never a false critical flag), mirroring the
        ``customer:`` (#429) / ``voice:`` (#461) declared-but-missing
        posture.

        Example::

            documents:
              - slug: botho-from-the-basics
                artifact_type: primer
                spec_ref: ../whitepaper/whitepaper.5/whitepaper.md
    code_ref
        Optional companion-input path/glob for the ``anvil:spec`` skill
        (issue #697/#706): the **implementation** a normative spec
        describes and must stay truthful to. The mirror image of
        primer's ``spec_ref`` — where a primer teaches *alongside* a
        formal spec, a spec is normatively describing an *implementation*.
        Resolved project-root-first then consumer-root by
        :func:`resolve_code_ref` (structurally identical to
        :func:`resolve_spec_ref`). ``spec-audit`` reads the resolved
        implementation as its consistency oracle; the three-way audit
        verdict ("spec claim contradicts implementation") lands in Phase 2
        (#707).

        Type-and-emptiness only at parse time (non-empty string;
        whitespace-only normalizes to ``None``) — file existence is a
        resolution-time concern. The activation contract lives in
        ``anvil/skills/spec/SKILL.md`` §"Code-ref contract": **absent**
        → the consistency tier is silent/off and both critics record a

class ProjectBrief(BaseModel):
    """The parsed project-level ``BRIEF.md`` frontmatter.

    Attributes
    ----------
    project
        Project name. Required, non-empty. Surfaced for human reference
        (printed in reports, headers, audit logs); not used as a
        filesystem key.
    audience
        Free-string descriptors of the project audience. The BRIEF
        author lists them in priority order (primary first); the
        loader does NOT enforce any ordering convention.

        Two on-disk shapes are accepted (issue #546): a YAML list of
        strings (the canonical flat form — drafter controls the
        order), OR a mapping with role-keyed sub-keys (``primary``,
        ``secondary``, ``tertiary``, with unknown roles preserved as
        a forward-compat surface) whose values are strings or lists
        of strings. The dict shape is flattened in role-precedence
        order — ``primary`` first, ``secondary`` next, then
        ``tertiary``, then any unknown sub-keys in YAML insertion
        order — so this field remains ``List[str]`` regardless of the
        on-disk shape. See :func:`_normalize_audience`.
    hard_rules
        Cross-document discipline rules that apply to every document in
        the project. Free strings; the reviewer treats each as a
        critical-check candidate per existing memo-review §"hard rules"
        machinery. Allowed to be empty.
    documents
        Per-document entries. Must be non-empty (a BRIEF with an empty
        documents list does NOT trigger project-brief layout per
        ``project_discovery.has_project_brief`` — this loader only
        accepts BRIEFs that already pass the discovery gate). Slugs are
        guaranteed unique by the parser.
    theme
        Optional brand-theme name (issue #322). When set, the per-skill
        asset resolvers (template + stylesheet + accent) consult
        ``<consumer>/.anvil/themes/<theme>/`` as a precedence tier
        between the consumer single-tenant override and the framework
        default. Free string — theme names are consumer-defined; no
        enum validation is enforced. A name pointing to a missing theme
        directory is tolerated (the resolver falls through to the next
        tier silently).
    voice
        Optional voice/persona grounding-docs block (issue #461). When
        set, the drafter loads the declared docs in the documented
        order (values → style_guide → vocabulary → corpus exemplars)
        and the reviewer calibrates its owned dimension against them
        per ``anvil/lib/snippets/voice_grounding.md``. Absent →
        byte-identical behavior (the #428/#452 activation pattern).
        Path resolution is deferred to :func:`resolve_voice_docs`.
    corpus
        Optional list of read-only ground-truth corpus directory paths
        (issue #597). Distinct from ``voice.corpus`` (a single glob of
        author-persona *published* exemplars): this top-level ``corpus:``
        declares **factual** ground truth — interview transcripts, family
        letters, engagement notes — that the per-version ``provenance.md``
        claim→source map cites and the corpus-audit critic verifies
        against per ``anvil/lib/snippets/provenance.md``. ``None`` = tier
        inactive (absent key, ``null``, or empty list) → byte-identical
        behavior. Path resolution is deferred to
        :func:`resolve_corpus_dirs`.

    :func:`_validate_code_ref`) when the declared value is present but not
    a string (e.g. a YAML list, int, or dict).

    Why a dedicated subclass: the companion-ref resolvers
    (:func:`resolve_spec_ref` / :func:`resolve_code_ref`) load the BRIEF
    leniently and blanket-swallow a plain ``ValueError`` to ``None`` (the
    "BRIEF doesn't parse → tier INACTIVE" path). That blanket swallow
    cannot distinguish "the whole BRIEF is structurally invalid" from
    "this one companion-ref field is malformed" — so a malformed
    ``spec_ref`` / ``code_ref`` was silently reclassified as *absent*,
    disabling the consistency tier with no operator-visible signal
    (exactly the state the SKILL.md §Spec-ref / §Code-ref contracts say
    should never carry a broken-but-undetected declaration).

    Because this subclasses ``ValueError``, every *other* caller of

    as before — a malformed companion-ref is still a hard schema error for
    them. Only the two lenient companion-ref resolvers catch it
    *specially*, converting it into the existing ``missing: true``
    structured-defect result (tier ACTIVE, ``major`` finding) rather than
    swallowing it to ``None`` (tier inactive).

    The ``field`` attribute (``"spec_ref"`` / ``"code_ref"``) lets each
    resolver recognize a malformed value of *its own* field and ignore an
    unrelated companion-ref field's malformed value (which should still
    swallow to ``None`` for it, exactly as any other unrelated BRIEF-parse
    failure would).

    -------
    Optional[ProjectBrief]

    The voice/persona grounding-docs resolution helper. Reads

    block is declared, resolves each declared doc in the documented
    load order — **values → style_guide → vocabulary → corpus** (the
    order the drafter consumes them per
    ``anvil/lib/snippets/voice_grounding.md``).

    Path resolution — **project root first, then consumer root** (the
    #322/#394 walk; first hit wins):

    1. ``<project_dir>/<declared>`` — a project ghostwriting in a
       different persona shadows the repo-level docs locally.
    2. ``<consumer_root>/<declared>`` — the common case: voice docs
       are persona-level repo-root artifacts (``STYLE_GUIDE.md``,
       ``VOCABULARY.md``, ``VALUES.md``, ``writing-corpus/``) shared
       across every project in the consumer repo. The consumer root
       is the directory carrying the ``.anvil/`` install marker,
       discovered via :func:`anvil.lib.theme.find_consumer_root`
       unless an explicit ``consumer_root`` override is supplied
       (test fixtures / callers that already know the root).

    Absolute declared paths are used as-is. The ``corpus`` value is a
    glob (``Path.glob`` semantics, ``**`` supported); matches are
    sorted; a root "hits" when the glob matches ≥1 file.

    **Git status is never consulted.** Resolution is purely
    filesystem-driven, so a ``.gitignored`` declared doc resolves and
    activates the tier *identically* to a committed one. This is the
    designed, tested posture behind **private voice grounding** (issue
    #577; ``anvil/lib/snippets/voice_grounding.md`` §"Private
    grounding"): a personal ``VALUES.local.md``-class doc can be
    gitignored to keep the source out of the repo while still grounding
    drafting and review. There is no special private code path here — a
    gitignored doc that is declared-but-missing surfaces the same
    ``major`` finding as any other missing declared doc.

    **Never raises on absence.** Missing-file results come back as
    structured ``missing: true`` entries — a broken declaration is a
    defect for the reviewer to surface (``major`` finding), not an
    opt-out and not a crash (the ``customer_context.py`` posture).

    List[ResolvedVoiceDoc]
        One entry per **declared grounding-doc** sub-key, in load
        order. ``rhetoric_rules`` (issue #468) NEVER appears here — it

    rather than a file or glob. Reads ``<project_dir>/BRIEF.md`` leniently

    Path resolution — **project root first, then consumer root** (the same

    2. ``<consumer_root>/<declared>`` — the common case: a project-level

       via :func:`anvil.lib.theme.find_consumer_root` unless an explicit
       ``consumer_root`` override is supplied).

    Absolute declared paths are used as-is (``source="absolute"``). A path
    "resolves" when it names an existing **directory** at a root — a file
    of the same name does not satisfy the corpus contract.

# Spec code-ref resolution (issue #697/#706)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# DESIGN DECISION — standalone mirror, NOT a generalized resolver.
#
# ``code_ref`` (the implementation an ``anvil:spec`` normatively describes)
# is structurally identical to primer's ``spec_ref`` (the formal sibling a
# primer teaches alongside): a freeform path/glob, resolved project-root-
# first then consumer-root, never raising on absence, carrying a
# ``missing: true`` entry for a declared-but-unresolvable path. It would be
# tempting to fold both into a single ``resolve_companion_ref(kind, ...)``.
#
# We deliberately ship a STANDALONE mirror (``resolve_code_ref`` /
# ``ResolvedCodeRef``) rather than generalizing, for three reasons:
#
#   1. **Zero blast radius to primer.** Generalizing would touch
#      ``resolve_spec_ref``'s call sites across five shipped primer command
#      docs. A Phase-1 skeleton PR should not risk primer's shipped
#      behavior for a DRY win.
#   2. **CLAUDE.md convention: "skill-local first, lib promotion later."**
#      The extraction pattern is "wait for the SECOND consumer before
#      generalizing." ``spec_ref`` and ``code_ref`` are the first two
#      companion-ref consumers; a THIRD plausible consumer is the right
#      trigger to hoist a shared ``resolve_companion_ref`` — not the second.
#   3. **Distinct semantics downstream.** ``spec_ref`` feeds a binary
#      "contradicts / doesn't" audit; ``code_ref`` feeds a THREE-way verdict
#      (spec-wrong / code-wrong / intentional-gap; Phase 2 / #707). Keeping

    The companion-input analog of :class:`ResolvedSpecRef`, for the
    ``anvil:spec`` skill: the **implementation** (source tree, wire-format
    reference, consensus-rule code) that a normative spec describes and
    must stay truthful to. ``spec-audit`` reads the resolved
    implementation as its consistency oracle; the full three-way verdict
    ("spec claim contradicts implementation" — spec-wrong / code-wrong /
    intentional-gap) lands in Phase 2 (#707).

    Missing-file results are carried as a **structured** ``missing:
    true`` entry — resolution never raises on absence. A ``missing:
    true`` entry ACTIVATES the consistency tier and is the spec critics'
    signal to surface a ``major`` finding (broken declaration) while
    degrading gracefully (no cross-check, no false critical flag) — the
    same defect-to-surface posture as ``spec_ref``.

    """Resolve a spec document's ``code_ref`` to on-disk path(s) (issue #706).

    The companion-input resolution helper for the ``anvil:spec`` skill —
    the mirror image of :func:`resolve_spec_ref`. Reads
    ``<project_dir>/BRIEF.md`` leniently, looks up the document by
    ``slug``, and — when that document declares a ``code_ref`` — resolves
    it **project-root first, then consumer-root** (absolute paths bypass
    the walk), the same walk ``spec_ref`` / the ``voice:`` docs use. A
    ``code_ref`` may be a plain path or a glob (the common case for a
    multi-file implementation, e.g. ``../../src/**/*.rs``); glob matches
    are sorted and the first root with ≥1 match wins.

    **List declarations (issue #719).** ``code_ref`` may declare a YAML
    list of independent path/glob strings — the natural shape for a
    multi-crate / multi-module implementation spanning non-contiguous
    roots (a normative spec's implementation is rarely one glob-contiguous
    tree). Each element resolves independently (its own root walk); the
    results are unioned in **declaration order** and **deduped** (first-
    seen order preserved) into ``.paths``. Per-element accounting:

    - ALL elements resolve → ``missing=False``, ``unresolved=[]``.
    - SOME resolve, some don't (partial miss) → ``missing=False``,
      ``unresolved`` = the non-matching declared strings (declaration
      order); the sweep still runs against ``.paths`` and the spec critics
      add a ``major`` finding naming the unresolved entries.
    - ZERO resolve → ``missing=True`` (byte-identical to today's single-
      string all-missing case).

    A scalar declaration is the one-element case: ``unresolved`` is always
    empty (a lone bad path is the ZERO-resolve → ``missing=True`` case).

    **Never raises on absence.** A declared-but-missing ``code_ref`` comes
    back as a structured ``missing: true`` :class:`ResolvedCodeRef` — the
    tier still activates and the spec critics surface a ``major`` finding,
    degrading gracefully (no crash, no false critical flag).

    A **malformed** ``code_ref`` (declared but the wrong type — e.g. a
    YAML list, int, or dict) is NOT the inactive path (issue #718): it is
    a declared-but-broken declaration, so it comes back as a structured
    ``missing: true`` :class:`ResolvedCodeRef` (tier ACTIVE, ``major``
    finding) — the same posture as a declared-but-unresolvable path. The
    clear type error from :func:`_validate_code_ref` is preserved in the
    ``declared`` field so it reaches the operator instead of being
    silently swallowed.

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[ResolvedCodeRef]

# Thread-level BRIEF.md helpers (issue #348)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The thread-level ``<thread>/BRIEF.md`` is a SEPARATE on-disk surface from the
# project-level ``<project>/BRIEF.md`` parsed above. The thread-level BRIEF
# is intentionally **freeform prose** with optional YAML frontmatter — it
# documents the drafter's context (company / sector / stage / check_size)
# and the operator's recommendation posture. Recognized informal frontmatter
# keys are documented in ``anvil/skills/memo/commands/memo-draft.md`` step 3:
# ``company``, ``sector``, ``stage``, ``check_size``, and
# ``recommendation_target`` (one of ``invest`` / ``pass`` / ``conditional`` /
# ``undecided``).
#
# These keys are **purely informational passthrough** for most consumers; the
# drafter reads them into context but no structural module parses them.
# Issue #348 promotes the one structurally-load-bearing key —
# ``recommendation_target`` — into a typed signal so the reviewer can
# calibrate dim 1 (Recommendation clarity) appropriately when the operator
# explicitly declared the thread is in pre-decision mode
# (``recommendation_target: undecided``).
#
# The helper is intentionally **lenient** — every absence path returns
# ``None`` so callers can branch on ``is None`` without try/except. The
# contract mirrors :func:`load_rubric_overrides_for_slug` for the
# project-level surface.

# Closed set of recognized ``recommendation_target`` values.
# The closed set is the contract: typos like ``Undecided`` (capitalized),
# ``tbd``, ``?``, ``maybe`` are NOT recognized and resolve to ``None``
# (the reviewer falls back to the legacy dim 1 calibration — same behavior
# as a thread with no BRIEF). This prevents the structured-field surface
# from silently accepting noise.

    reviewer can calibrate dim 1 (Recommendation clarity) against.

    ----------
    thread_dir

        the thread, e.g., ``<project>/<slug>/``). NOT a version directory.

    -------
    Optional[Literal["invest", "pass", "conditional", "undecided"]]
        The verbatim ``recommendation_target`` value when present and in the
        closed set. ``None`` for every absence / malformed path:

        - ``<thread_dir>/BRIEF.md`` does not exist.
        - The file exists but has no YAML frontmatter (no opening ``---``
          delimiter, missing closing delimiter, malformed YAML).
        - The frontmatter is a parseable dict but contains no
          ``recommendation_target`` key.
        - The frontmatter value is not in the closed set
          (``invest`` / ``pass`` / ``conditional`` / ``undecided``) — e.g.,
          ``Undecided`` (capitalized), ``tbd``, ``maybe``, ``?``, an integer,
          a list, a null. The reviewer falls back to byte-identical
          pre-#348 behavior for these noise values.

    Notes
    -----
    Lenient by design — never raises. The contract mirrors
    :func:`load_rubric_overrides_for_slug`'s "empty / None on every absence
    path" lenient form so the reviewer's zero-impact backwards-compat is
    preserved exactly for any thread that pre-dates this helper or that
    chose not to set the field.

    The thread-level BRIEF is a SEPARATE surface from the project-level
    BRIEF parsed by :func:`load_project_brief`. The two share frontmatter
    extraction primitive (:func:`_extract_frontmatter`) but the schema
    contracts are distinct: project-level BRIEF is STRICT (typo in
    ``artifact_type`` raises); thread-level BRIEF is FREEFORM PROSE with
    informal frontmatter. This helper extracts only the one structured
    field; everything else is passed through to the drafter as
    informational context.

def body_filename_for(slug: str) -> str:
    """Return the body markdown filename for a memo thread.

    Issue #295 (project-org model lock) pins the body filename
    convention: every version directory's body markdown **echoes the
    thread slug** as ``<slug>.md`` (e.g. ``investment-memo.1/`` carries
    ``investment-memo.md``, ``latency-wall.1/`` carries
    ``latency-wall.md``). This is the only recognized shape; there is
    no override mechanism.

    This helper is the single source of truth so a future shape change
    (vanishingly unlikely under the slug-echo contract) lands in one
    place. Lifecycle commands and lib modules that need to read or
    write the body file should call this helper rather than hard-coding
    ``f"{slug}.md"`` inline.

    Lives in ``project_brief.py`` after the issue #296 consolidation
    (its prior home, ``anvil_config.py``, was retired). The helper is a
    one-line ``f"{slug}.md"`` wrapper; placing it next to the project-
    config schema keeps every project / per-doc convention in one
    place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    slug
