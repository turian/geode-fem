"""Dangling-citation lint for `anvil:project-share` (issue #758).

The exporter's `verify` step (issue #396) checks *layout* — the marker
is present, every planned file landed, no stripped name leaked — but it
never looks at *content*. A thread body (or a shared `research/` pool
file) can cite a project-root working document (e.g.
`STRATEGIC-OPTIONS.md`) or a sibling file that never makes it into the
export set; for the recipient that citation is a dangling pointer with
nothing on the other end. This surfaced in the studio (canary)
packaging praetor: three exported files cited `STRATEGIC-OPTIONS.md`, a
project-root working document that was never part of the export.

This is the export-time analog of the memo skill's refs back-check:
references should resolve within the world the reader receives.

This module scans every markdown file the plan is about to copy
(per-doc body + refs, and the shared `research/` pool) for tokens that
look like a repo-relative file reference — a markdown link
(``[text](path)``) or a bare backticked/prose filename (`` `STRATEGIC-
OPTIONS.md` ``) — and, when that reference resolves to a REAL file
somewhere in the project tree that is NOT part of this export's planned
copy set, records a finding.

This is deliberately a **report, not a block** (the citation may be
intentional — an internal cross-reference the recipient isn't meant to
follow) per the issue's acceptance criteria. Findings surface in the run
summary (``--dry-run`` and apply mode alike, since the check only reads
already-collected plan data — nothing about it requires the out dir to
exist) and in ``EXPORT.md``.

Resolution is intentionally conservative: a candidate is only reported
when it resolves to a file that actually exists on disk somewhere in
the project. This avoids false positives on prose that merely LOOKS
like a filename (typos, external tool names, code identifiers) — those
don't resolve to anything and are silently ignored.
