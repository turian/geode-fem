| Claim | Source file | Line range | Classification | tool_calls evidence |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Well, I remember it clear as anything." | transcripts/grani-01.md | 5 | VERIFIED | Read transcripts/grani-01.md:5 — exact match: "Well, I remember it clear as anything." |
| "It was a Tuesday, hot as blazes" | transcripts/grani-01.md | 5-6 | VERIFIED | Read transcripts/grani-01.md:5-6 — exact match: "It was a Tuesday, hot as blazes". |
| Grani was eight years old the day the factory burned | transcripts/grani-01.md | 11 | PARAPHRASE_OK | Read transcripts/grani-01.md:11 — "I was eight years old" supports the paraphrase; substance present, wording is authorial paraphrase. |
| The journey west took six weeks | letters/1952-aug.md | 3-4 | PARAPHRASE_OK | Read letters/1952-aug.md:3-4 — "It has been six weeks since we left Carthage" supports the paraphrase. |
| Ruth reached Tulsa by the end of the month | letters/1952-aug.md | 5 | NOT_FOUND | Read letters/1952-aug.md:5 — "We should reach Tulsa by the end of the month" states intent, not a confirmed arrival; no passage in either corpus root confirms arrival. Not a critical flag: the chapter prose already reflects this uncertainty explicitly. |
