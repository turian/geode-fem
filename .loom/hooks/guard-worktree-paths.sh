#!/usr/bin/env bash
# guard-worktree-paths.sh - PreToolUse hook to confine Edit/Write to worktree
#
# Blocks Edit and Write tool calls whose file_path resolves outside a
# builder's issue worktree. This prevents builders from escaping their
# worktree and modifying files in the main repository (see issue #2441,
# #4007).
#
# Two independent mechanisms, tried in order:
#
#   1. Env fast path (LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH): when set, only that exact
#      worktree is allowed. Set by tmux/manual sessions that pin one process
#      to one worktree. This is unchanged from the original hook.
#
#   2. Path-derived fallback (no LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH): a daemon-dispatched
#      sweep hosts multiple Task-subagent builders (different issues) in one
#      shared process env, so a single process-wide LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH
#      cannot work there (#3719) -- nothing sets it on that path and the
#      hook was structurally inert. Instead, derive the answer from the
#      target path itself: walk up from the resolved target looking for the
#      `.loom-managed` sentinel that `worktree.sh` writes at the root of
#      every worktree it creates (and never at the main repo root). If the
#      target is inside ANY managed worktree, allow it -- we cannot tell
#      which issue a given subagent owns (no ambient signal exists for
#      that), so this deliberately does not attempt cross-issue isolation.
#      What it DOES catch -- the actual failure mode in #2802 / #3513 /
#      #4007 -- is a write that resolves to the MAIN checkout (typically a
#      repo-relative path evaluated after a cwd reset) while worktree
#      isolation is in play for this repo/session (i.e. at least one
#      managed worktree currently exists). If no managed worktree has ever
#      been created, the hook fails open -- there is nothing to protect.
#
# Toggle: guards.worktreeIsolation (default true) / LOOM_GUARD_WORKTREE_ISOLATION
# env override, following the resolution order used by every other guard
# category in this repo (env > config > default; pattern documented at
# guard-destructive-generic.sh around the guards.sqlDdl toggle).
#
# Input (JSON on stdin):
#   { "tool_input": { "file_path": "/path/to/file", ... }, "cwd": "/cwd" }
#
# Output:
#   Exit 0 with no output = allow
#   Exit 0 with JSON { "hookSpecificOutput": { "permissionDecision": "deny", ... } } = block
#
# Contract: NEVER exits non-zero. Fails open on every unexpected condition
# (missing jq, unparseable input, no sentinel anywhere, resolver errors) so a
# broken guard cannot wedge all agent writes.

# Determine main repo root via git-common-dir (works from worktrees and subdirectories).
# `pwd -P` (physical, symlinks resolved) rather than plain `pwd` (#4495): the
# target path is canonicalized with symlinks resolved below, so the root it is
# compared against must be resolved the same way — otherwise a repo reached
# through a symlinked ancestor (the common case for `/tmp` on macOS, which is a
# symlink to `/private/tmp`) never string-matches and the deny silently misses.

# ...and the LOGICAL spelling of the same root (symlinks intact). Both are kept

# normalization on a host without python3/GNU realpath (or an install that
# predates defaults/scripts/lib/canonical-path.sh). In that degraded mode a

# CARVE-OUT (#4241, same class as #4063), UPDATED for Epic #3835 Phase 5
# (#4262): worktree_isolation_guard_enabled() is called UNCONDITIONALLY as the
# very first thing this hook does, on EVERY Edit/Write PreToolUse -- there is
# no cheaper structural pre-check upstream of it (unlike
# guard-destructive-generic.sh's cold-path toggles, which only read config
# lazily after a specific pattern has already matched). loom_resolve_config
# soft-reads all tier files plus a merge on every call, so calling it directly
# from BOTH readers below would double the fork cost. Instead,
# resolved_config() (below) calls loom_resolve_config() at most ONCE per
# invocation and caches the merged JSON string; both readers then run one
# cheap in-memory `jq` filter against that cached string (no extra file I/O).
# This is exactly the mitigation this carve-out originally called for --
# "prefer caching a repo-scoped loom_resolve_config() result once per
# process" -- so `.loom-project/project.json` (and every other tier) now
# reaches both toggles without re-forking the merge per reader.

# so a resolver failure still degrades to the pre-#4262 "no config, fall back
# to the default" behavior rather than propagating an error. This lets
# `.loom-project/project.json -> worktree.root` (Epic #3835) reach this guard
# without a second, independent read path to keep in lockstep.
