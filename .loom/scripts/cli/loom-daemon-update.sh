# loom-daemon-update.sh - Self-update the RAW loom-daemon process (Issue #3968)
#
# Closes the "self-update gap" observed during the 2026-07-25/26 canary
# rollout: the daemon's self-repair loop filed AND fixed 16 of its own
# defects, but every merged fix only took effect after an operator manually
# rebuilt the Rust binary, reprovisioned it, and restarted the process. This
# script is the single operator command that does all three, in order,
# preserving the FLAGS-OFF/opt-in autonomy contract across the restart.
#
# Staleness detection strategy (primary, zero-network): compare the git
# commit BAKED INTO the currently-resolved `loom-daemon` binary (embedded at
# build time via build.rs -> LOOM_DAEMON_GIT_COMMIT, surfaced in
# `loom-daemon --version`) against the LOCAL source tree's current HEAD short
# commit. This answers the directly actionable question — "would rebuilding
# right now produce a different binary?" — without touching the network.
#
# Checkout freshness (default, ff-first — #4330): the whole point of running
# this script is to get the daemon onto the LATEST code, so before resolving
# the local HEAD used for the staleness comparison above, this script attempts
# a bounded, best-effort `git fetch` of origin/<default-branch> and, if local
# HEAD is behind, a `git merge --ff-only`. On success the rebuild below builds
# the freshly-synced HEAD. If the ff-merge cannot apply (diverged local
# commits, or a dirty tracked file conflicts with the incoming change) the
# script ABORTS (exit 1) rather than guessing or hard-resetting — a stale
# rebuild silently missing merged commits (the 2026-07-29 incident this issue
# closes) is worse than a loud abort asking the operator to resolve it by
# hand. A fetch failure/timeout (offline, network degraded) is NOT treated as
# "behind" — the script warns and proceeds with local HEAD as-is, so this
# check never makes the script hard-network-dependent. `--allow-stale`
# restores the pre-#4330 build-what's-here behavior (skips the fetch+merge
# entirely) for deliberate use (bisecting, testing a local patch) — see below.
#
# It:
#   - detects whether the resolved binary is stale vs. the local source tree
#     (or, in artifact-fetch mode, vs. the latest GitHub Release — see below),
#   - Artifact-fetch mode (Epic #4990 Phase 3, #5020, ON by default, opt out
#     with --no-fetch): resolves the latest GitHub Release with version >=
#     the installed daemon and, when that release publishes an artifact for
#     this host's platform, downloads + verifies it (checksum unconditional,
#     signature when present) INSTEAD of rebuilding from source — a
#     saturated host with no Rust toolchain converges on a release alone.
#     Resolution failure of any kind (unrecognized platform, no `gh` CLI, no
#     Releases yet, API unreachable, no artifact for this platform) SOFTLY
#     falls back to the rebuild path below (--fetch instead hard-fails).
#   - rebuilds (`cargo build --release`) in loom-daemon/ when stale (or
#     --force) AND no artifact was fetched,
#   - provisions the fresh binary to wherever the resolved binary lives
#     (LOOM_DAEMON_BIN override, else the machine-level ~/.local/bin install
#     via scripts/install/provision-daemon.sh, matching #3922's convention),
#   - reads the flags loom-daemon-start.sh persisted at the last invocation
#     (.loom/.daemon.flags, #3968) and restarts with EXACTLY those flags —
#     never more, never fewer. A daemon that was NOT running is left
#     stopped (this script never widens FLAGS-OFF by starting autonomy that
#     wasn't already running).
#
# Stale-entry-point advisory (#4079 hardening, epic #4081 Phase 4 / #4557):
# on every path — including --check, --dry-run, and an up-to-date no-op — this
# script scans PATH for `loom-*` executables that do NOT resolve to the
# loom-daemon binary it just resolved, and WARNS about each one. This is the
# #4079 failure mode: a long-gone `pip install -e loom-tools` left frozen
# console scripts in ~/.local/bin that kept shadowing the Rust binary's own
# entry points, so agents ran ancient logic while `--version` looked fresh.
# Since #4557 deleted that Python package, nothing regenerates such scripts
# ever again. The warning ALSO fires when PATH holds more than one
# `loom-daemon` (the first shadows the rest). It is advisory only: nothing is
# deleted, PATH is untouched, and the exit code is unaffected. The
# auto-generated `loom-clean`/`loom-recover-orphans`/`loom-claim` shims
# (#4272/#4275) pointing at the resolved binary are never flagged. (`loom-search`
# was allowlisted here as a legitimate non-daemon Python console script from
# #4557 through #4969 — #4970 retired that package too, so a `loom-search` on
# PATH is now exactly the #4079 failure shape and IS flagged, like any other
# stale entry point.) Suppress with LOOM_SKIP_STALE_ENTRY_POINT_CHECK=1.
#
# Launchd-managed daemons (#4042): on Darwin the daemon is commonly launchd-
# managed (default since #3972/#4054), in which case NEITHER .loom/.daemon.pid
# nor .loom/.daemon.flags reliably reflects "is it running" — the pid file goes
# stale after any KeepAlive:SuccessfulExit relaunch, and a hand-bootstrapped
# daemon has no state files at all. This script therefore checks the launchd job
# state (`launchctl print <domain>/<label>`, where <domain> is
# resolve_launchd_domain()'s gui/<uid> ↦ user/<uid> pick — #4130 — mirroring
# loom-daemon-stop.sh) AHEAD of the pid-file tier when resolving whether/how the
# daemon is running.
# When launchd-managed, it restarts via the `loom-daemon restart` primitive
# (#4077 — sends Request::RestartDaemon over the IPC socket; the supervised
# daemon exits 0 and launchd relaunches it onto the fresh binary with the
# plist's persisted ProgramArguments/EnvironmentVariables). .daemon.flags is NOT
# consulted in this mode (the plist's EnvironmentVariables IS the durable flag
# source), and no "restarting FLAGS-OFF" warning fires. If the running (old)
# binary predates #4077 and refuses the request, this script REFUSES LOUDLY
# (exit 6) and prints how to re-render the plist + relaunch under supervision
# (loom-daemon-update.sh --relaunch), rather than reporting a half-update — the
# exact #4011 silent-autonomy-loss class this closes. The old advice to bootstrap
# the EXISTING plist was itself a bug (#4118): it relaunched under the STALE plist
# (no KeepAlive:SuccessfulExit, no LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR), so every subsequent
# roll hit the same exit 6 forever. It was ALSO documented (here, through
# 2026-08-03) as killing in-flight sweeps via bootout tearing down the job tree
# — that claim is STALE (#5081): since #3800 (2026-07-22) every sweep is spawned
# as its OWN process group (`Command::process_group(0)`), and launchd's bootout
# tears down the job's process group specifically, so a detached sweep is never
# reached by it — it reparents to pid 1 and keeps running. Confirmed both by
# code (dispatch.rs, `#4980`'s persisted pgid relies on this same fact) and by
# observation (three bootout+bootstrap cycles on 2026-08-03, #5081). --relaunch
# is still the recommended path here, but for a DIFFERENT reason: `launchctl
# bootout` is asynchronous, and a hand-run bootstrap immediately after it can
# race the still-in-progress teardown and fail with "Bootstrap failed: 5:
# Input/output error", leaving the daemon down until a retry. --relaunch
# re-renders via loom-daemon-start.sh (installing the supervised keys) while
# preserving the live plist's LOOM_* autonomy env; loom-daemon-start.sh's own
# bootout+bootstrap sequence settles after bootout, retries the bootstrap step
# on that specific race, and verifies the relaunched job's live pid + reported
# environment before reporting success (#5081) — a hand-typed bootout+bootstrap
# gets none of that safety net.
#
# systemd --user-managed daemons (Linux, #4260 sub-issue C): the exact same
# ownership-tiering + supervised-restart contract, ported to the systemd --user
# service loom-daemon-start.sh installs (#4268). A `systemd --user` unit's pid
# also goes stale on every `Restart=on-success` relaunch, so it is checked at the
# SAME tier as launchd, ahead of the pid-file tier. The restart itself is driven
# by the identical `loom-daemon restart` IPC primitive (recognized daemon-side by
# `detect_supervisor()` since #4267/PR #4298 when `LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd`
# is present — baked into the rendered unit by loom-daemon-start.sh); a clean
# exit 0 lets systemd's `Restart=on-success` relaunch onto the fresh binary.
# That ack is verified, not trusted (#4950, mirroring #4232's launchd
# verification): the script polls for a NEW, live MainPID within a bounded
# window before reporting success, and — if the unit does not come back on its
# own — self-heals via `systemctl --user reset-failed <unit> && systemctl --user
# start <unit>` before giving up (exit 7). #5119 widened that self-heal: on a
# busy host the daemon's clean exit can leave the unit sitting in
# `deactivating (stop-sigterm)` for the full TimeoutStopSec while systemd reaps
# the sweep/role children still in the service cgroup — far past the pid poll on
# a STALE unit (default 90s). The verifier now WAITS for a transitional stop to
# settle (LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_SETTLE_SECS), then self-heals ANY non-`active` settled
# state (`failed` — the #4950 stop-timeout shape — as well as `inactive`),
# instead of the pre-#5119 behavior of only acting on an already-`failed`
# snapshot and otherwise "refusing to guess" (which left the 2026-08-03
# loom-worker-1 daemon down until a hand `reset-failed && start`). On a
# refused restart (a pre-#4267 binary with no RestartDaemon handler, or a dead
# socket), the script refuses loudly (exit 6) exactly like launchd, and
# --relaunch (or LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RELAUNCH=1) re-renders the unit and forces
# the relaunch: it harvests the live unit's `Environment=` LOOM_*/token lines,
# SIGTERMs the running daemon (so sweep children reparent instead of being torn
# down), then re-invokes loom-daemon-start.sh — which re-renders the unit
# (installing `LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd`), reloads, and `enable --now`s it
# onto a now-inactive unit, i.e. a genuine restart. `LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD=0`
# disables ALL systemd interaction symmetrically with loom-daemon-start.sh
# --no-systemd / loom-daemon-stop.sh, so a --no-systemd install is never probed
# via systemctl and follows the PID-file/nohup restart path instead. Darwin
# behavior is entirely unaffected — this tier is inert unless
# `is_linux_systemd()` (lib/systemd-user.sh) resolves true.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh              Detect, rebuild if stale, provision, restart (preserving flags)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --check       Detect only; exit 0 (up to date) or 3 (update available); no writes
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --dry-run     Print the plan without building/provisioning/restarting
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --force       Rebuild + provision + restart even if already up to date
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --no-restart  Rebuild + provision only; leave the running daemon untouched
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --relaunch    Launchd/systemd only: after a refused restart, re-render the plist/unit and relaunch under supervision (SIGTERMs the daemon so sweep children reparent; preserves the live LOOM_* env)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --drain        Launchd/systemd only (Issue #5138): restart via the existing `loom-daemon restart --drain` primitive (#4090) instead of an immediate restart — pauses dispatch, waits for every in-flight sweep to finish (so sweep.completed/sweep.outcome telemetry is never lost, #5084), THEN relaunches. On systemd this is now the DEFAULT (see below) because an immediate restart there is actively destructive (#5119), not merely lossy — this flag is for opting IN on launchd, or for being explicit on systemd. A drain that cannot finish within its timeout leaves the CURRENT (pre-update) binary running rather than cancelling sweeps (fail-safe, unchanged from #4090) and this script says so clearly (exit 8). Same as LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_DRAIN=1. Combine with the single-invocation roll this issue closes: build + provision + drain-restart in one command, no more manual `--no-restart` then `loom-daemon restart --drain` two-step (that workaround still works unchanged, see --no-restart above).
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --timeout SECS Passthrough to `loom-daemon restart --drain --timeout SECS` (only meaningful with an active drain, explicit or systemd-default): max seconds to wait for in-flight sweeps before the fail-safe refuses the restart (daemon default: tens of minutes, currently 1800s). Ignored (with no error) when no drain is active.
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --force-after-timeout  Passthrough to `loom-daemon restart --drain --force-after-timeout` (only meaningful with an active drain): on a drain timeout, cancel the remaining in-flight sweep(s) and restart anyway instead of refusing. Without this, a drain timeout keeps the daemon running its PRE-update binary (the fail-safe) and this script exits 8. Ignored (with no error) when no drain is active.
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --restart-now   Systemd only (Issue #5138): opt OUT of the systemd drain-by-default behavior above and restart IMMEDIATELY (the pre-#5138 behavior on every supervisor) — for an operator who has confirmed nothing is in flight and wants the roll to finish as fast as possible. Mutually exclusive with --drain (exit 1 if both are given). No effect on launchd (already the default there) or the bare pid-file/nohup path (which never speaks the drain primitive at all).
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --allow-stale Skip the default ff-first sync with origin/<default-branch> and build the current (possibly stale) checkout as-is (#4330) — for deliberate use: bisecting, testing a local patch
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --auto-resolve-safe-abort  When the ff-only sync would otherwise hard-abort (#4330), auto-perform the fix IF the blocking state classifies as safe (#4951): content-identical diverged commits with an otherwise-CLEAN working tree (`git reset --hard origin/<default-branch>`), or dirty tracked files that are ALL Loom-managed installed copies (`git checkout --` them + re-run resync-installed.sh). Any other cause (genuine content divergence, any unmanaged dirty file, or a dirty tracked file co-existing with the content-identical divergence) still hard-aborts unchanged — this flag never widens what's classified as safe, only whether the safe cases are printed (default) or performed
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --fetch        Artifact-fetch mode (Epic #4990 Phase 3, #5020): REQUIRE a verified GitHub Release artifact for this host's platform (resolve latest Release >= installed version, download, verify checksum unconditionally + signature when present, provision) instead of `cargo build --release`; hard-fails (exit 1) rather than silently falling back to a source build when no matching artifact resolves. Same as LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_FETCH=1.
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --no-fetch      Disable artifact-fetch mode entirely; always use the local source-build path (pre-#5020 behavior). Same as LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_FETCH=0.
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --prune-stale-entry-points  Remove exactly the PATH entries the stale-entry-point advisory below (#4079/#4557) classifies as a "Python console script (stale pip/pipx editable install)" — a frozen console script left behind by the retired pip/pipx package (epic #4081 Phase 4 / #4557) that never resolves to the current loom-daemon binary and so is never touched by an update again. Conservative by construction: it reuses the SAME classification the advisory already computes, so `loom-daemon` itself and the auto-generated bash-wrapper shims (`loom-clean`/`loom-recover-orphans`/`loom-claim`, #4272/#4275 — including a STALE shim whose target moved) are never candidates, only ever reported. Standalone: performs the prune, reports what it removed, and exits — no build/provision/restart. Idempotent (a second run finds nothing to remove) and reports "nothing to prune" when the PATH is already clean. Honors LOOM_SKIP_STALE_ENTRY_POINT_CHECK=1 (a no-op, matching the check it would otherwise act on) (#5139).

#   LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_GH_REPO  Override the "owner/repo" slug used to
#                          resolve GitHub Releases (else parsed from the
#                          `origin` git remote).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_TARGET  Override the release target triple this host
#                          resolves to (else auto-detected from `uname -s -m`,
#                          e.g. aarch64-apple-darwin) — mainly for tests.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_COSIGN_PUBKEY  Path to the cosign public key used to

#                          i.e. GitHub Actions' OIDC provider).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN       Path to the loom-daemon binary (else auto-detected,
#                          same resolution as loom-daemon-start.sh). When set,
#                          the fresh binary is provisioned directly to this

#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR   Machine-level install dir (default ~/.local/bin),
#                          forwarded to provision-daemon.sh.
#   LOOM_SKIP_STALE_ENTRY_POINT_CHECK  1/true/yes suppresses the advisory

#   LOOM_SYSTEMD_UNIT      Linux only: the systemd --user unit to inspect/restart
#                          (default loom-daemon.service); must match the start's.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RELAUNCH  Launchd/systemd only: 1/true/yes is equivalent to

#                          on a refused restart).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_DRAIN  Launchd/systemd only (Issue #5138): 1/true/yes is
#                          equivalent to passing --drain. Has no effect on
#                          systemd's own default (already drained unless
#                          --restart-now/LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RESTART_NOW is given) —
#                          it exists mainly to opt IN on launchd, or in a script
#                          that wants to be explicit.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RESTART_NOW  Systemd only (Issue #5138): 1/true/yes is
#                          equivalent to passing --restart-now (opt OUT of the
#                          systemd drain-by-default and restart immediately).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_DRAIN_POLL_SECS  Seconds this script polls for the supervisor to

#                          failure (--force-after-timeout: falls through to the
#                          same self-heal fallback a plain restart uses).
#                          Default: the drain's own --timeout (or the daemon's
#                          built-in default, 1800s) plus a 60s grace buffer —
#                          long enough that a real drain is never mistaken for a
#                          hang. If LOOM_DAEMON_RESTART_POLL_SECS (below) is ALSO
#                          set, it wins over this default (drain or not) — an
#                          explicit poll-window override always takes
#                          precedence over either default.
#   LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT  Machine mode (Epic #3835 Phase 3b, #4229): set by the
#                          `scripts/loom` dispatcher to the resolved
#                          ~/.local/share/loom checkout before it execs this
#                          script. When set, THIS is the source tree rebuilt
#                          from (overriding the $PWD-based find_repo_root()
#                          below), so `loom update` works from any directory --
#                          a consumer repo, or no repo at all -- instead of
#                          requiring $PWD to already be inside a Loom source
#                          checkout. Direct invocation of this script (no
#                          dispatcher -- the existing dev workflow) never sets
#                          it and is unaffected.

#                          `restart` ack before falling back to the
#                          supervisor's self-heal (`launchctl kickstart` on

#                          up (default 15).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_SETTLE_SECS  Linux/systemd (#5119): after the pid poll

#                          unit (ActiveState=deactivating/activating) to SETTLE
#                          into a terminal state before running the reset-failed+
#                          start self-heal. Sized to exceed systemd's default 90s
#                          TimeoutStopSec so a stale unit's slow SIGTERM→SIGKILL
#                          cgroup teardown is waited out rather than mistaken for
#                          "refusing to guess" (default 100).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  up to date (no-op) OR rebuild+provision+restart succeeded
#   1  usage error / not a source checkout / build or provision failure /
#      the default ff-first sync with origin/<default-branch> could not apply
#      (diverged local commits, a dirty tracked file conflicting with the
#      incoming change, or HEAD is not on <default-branch>) — the script
#      NEVER guesses or hard-resets; resolve manually or pass --allow-stale
#      (#4330). Two of the ff-abort causes classify as safely resolvable
#      (#4951): content-identical diverged commits with an otherwise-CLEAN
#      working tree, or dirty tracked files that are ALL Loom-managed
#      installed copies — by default these still
#      exit 1 but the abort message names the exact safe command; pass
#      --auto-resolve-safe-abort to have the script perform it instead (exit
#      0 on success). Any other cause still hard-aborts unchanged. Also used
#      by artifact-fetch mode (#5020) for: a checksum mismatch on a
#      downloaded artifact (unconditional — leaves the running daemon
#      untouched), a signature-verification failure on a PRESENT signature
#      (distinct from "unsigned", which is not an error), and --fetch given
#      with no matching release artifact resolvable (refuses to silently
#      fall back to a source build). Also used by --prune-stale-entry-points
#      (#5139) if any candidate path failed to `rm` (permissions, a race) —
#      the paths that DID remove successfully are still reported individually
#      above the error.
#   3  (--check only) update available
#   4  build verification FAILED: the freshly-built binary's embedded commit
#      does not match the source HEAD it was built from. This is a BUILD-SYSTEM
#      defect (a stale baked-in commit — e.g. a build.rs watch-set bug), NOT a
#      compile failure, and retrying cannot fix it; the script refuses to
#      provision the mis-stamped binary (#4053).
#   5  post-provision verification FAILED: the destination binary after a
#      claimed-successful provision is not the expected build (a silent no-op
#      roll — "reports success while shipping nothing"). Distinct from both a
#      compile failure and a provisioning soft-failure (#4053).
#   6  supervised restart FAILED: the daemon is launchd- or systemd-managed but
#      the running (old) binary refused the `loom-daemon restart` IPC request (a
#      pre-#4077/#4267 binary with no RestartDaemon handler, or a dead socket).
#      The fresh binary IS provisioned but the OLD one is still running; the
#      script refuses to report success. Without --relaunch it prints how to
#      re-render the plist/unit and relaunch under supervision, then exits 6;
#      with --relaunch (or LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RELAUNCH=1) it performs that
#      re-render+relaunch itself, propagating loom-daemon-start.sh's exit code
#      (#4042, #4118, #4260 sub-issue C).
#   7  restart ACK'd but never took effect: the running (old) binary accepted
#      the `restart` IPC request (exit 0), but the supervisor never relaunched
#      the job/unit onto a NEW, live pid within the poll window, AND the
#      self-heal fallback also failed to bring it up within its own poll
#      window. On launchd (#4232) the fallback is a plain `launchctl
#      kickstart` (never -k). On systemd (#4950/#5119) the fallback is
#      `systemctl --user reset-failed <unit> && systemctl --user start <unit>`,
#      tried whenever the unit is NOT `active` — the confirmed-`failed`
#      `Result=timeout` stop escalation #4950 closes, AND (#5119) a unit still
#      stuck `deactivating`/`inactive` when the poll expired: after the poll the
#      script now WAITS up to LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_SETTLE_SECS for a transitional
#      unit's stop to complete, then self-heals the settled non-`active` state
#      rather than "refusing to guess" and leaving the daemon down (systemd never
#      auto-relaunches a failed/stopped unit even under `Restart=on-success`).
#      Only a genuinely `active` unit on an unobserved pid is left untouched. The
#      fresh binary IS provisioned, but the daemon's live status
#      is NOT confirmed — this is the "restart scheduled but the supervisor
#      silently never relaunched" outage class these issues close; the script
#      refuses to report success on the ack alone. A drain-mode restart
#      (--drain, or the systemd default, #5138) reaches this code ONLY when
#      --force-after-timeout was also given and the forced restart still never
#      took effect — see exit 8 for the (expected, not a failure) case where a
#      drain timed out WITHOUT --force-after-timeout.
#   8  drain fail-safe preserved (Issue #5138, launchd/systemd only): a
#      drain-mode restart (--drain, or the systemd default) timed out WITHOUT
#      --force-after-timeout, and the daemon's own fail-safe (#4090) held:
#      dispatch resumed, no in-flight sweep was cancelled or killed, and
#      loom-daemon is STILL RUNNING its PRE-update binary (pid unchanged from
#      before the restart request). This is NOT a failure — it is the drain
#      primitive refusing to choose between "cancel work" and "restart" on the
#      operator's behalf, exactly as designed. The freshly-built/provisioned
#      binary IS staged at the resolved destination; it just was not activated
#      this run. Re-run once the in-flight sweep(s) finish, or re-run with
#      --force-after-timeout to force the roll through immediately.
#
# See also: loom-daemon-start.sh (writes .loom/.daemon.flags), loom-daemon-stop.sh
# (SIGTERM -> grace -> SIGKILL; in-flight sweeps survive by design — this
# script relies on that: stopping+restarting the dispatcher never kills
# dispatched work), scripts/install/provision-daemon.sh (machine-level
# provisioning, #3922).

# =====================================================================
#
# Phase 1 (#5003) and Phase 2 (#5011/#5018) publish, on every GitHub Release,
# `loom-daemon-<target>` + `<...>.sha256` for every fleet target triple
# (`aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
# `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`), plus an OPTIONAL Linux-only `<...>.sig`
# (detached cosign signature) when a cosign key secret was configured for
# that release. macOS artifacts are signed IN PLACE (embedded Developer ID
# signature, no separate asset) when the signing secrets were configured;
# there is no way to tell from the filename alone whether a given release's
# macOS asset is signed.
#
# This section resolves the latest Release with version >= the currently
# installed daemon, downloads the artifact for the host's own platform +
# its checksum (and signature, when present), and verifies both:
#   - checksum: UNCONDITIONAL. A mismatch hard-aborts the whole update
#     (exit 1) and leaves the running daemon untouched -- this is a
#     tamper/corruption signal, never a soft-fallback condition.
#   - signature: verified ONLY when present. macOS: `codesign --verify
#     --strict` against the downloaded binary (distinguishes "not signed"
#     -- expected, soft-skip -- from "signed but verification failed" --
#     abort). Linux: detached `.sig` via `cosign verify-blob` — KEYLESS
#     (Sigstore/OIDC) whenever the release also publishes the sibling
#     `<...>.pem` signing certificate, which needs no distributed key
#     material and therefore verifies for real on a stock install (#5054);
#     otherwise the pre-#5054 KEY mode, which still needs an operator-
#     provided public key and loud-skips without one. A missing `cosign`
#     binary is likewise a LOUD skip (never a block) per the epic's design
#     principle 2. Absence of a signature never blocks the update.
#
# Any OTHER resolution failure (unrecognized host platform, no `gh` CLI, no
# Releases yet, GitHub API unreachable/rate-limited, no artifact published
# for this platform) is a SOFT fallback to the existing local
# `cargo build --release` path below -- never a hard error -- unless the

# WHY KEYLESS IS THE DEFAULT (#5054, the decision this function encodes):
# Phase 2 (#5011) signed Linux artifacts with a cosign PRIVATE KEY held in an
# Actions secret, and Phase 3 (#5020) verified them against a public key that
# was never distributed -- so every real host loud-skipped. Distributing that
# public key (committing `defaults/cosign.pub`) would fix the skip but pins the
# whole fleet to one keypair: rotating it silently breaks verification on every
# host still carrying the old key, and the key must be provisioned as a secret
# before ANY release can be signed at all. Keyless Sigstore signing has neither
# problem -- the signer proves its identity with the GitHub Actions OIDC token
# the workflow already has, so signing needs NO secret to be provisioned and
# verification needs NO key material to be distributed. The trust root becomes
# an assertion about *who signed*, which is exactly what we care about:
#
#   "a workflow in the SAME repo this artifact was downloaded from, running at
#    EXACTLY this release's tag, with a certificate issued by GitHub Actions"
#
# The workflow FILE is intentionally not pinned (any `[^@]+` under
# `.github/workflows/`): pinning it would turn a future rename of
# `release.yml` into a fleet-wide hard-abort, while adding nothing -- anything
# able to run a workflow in this repo at this tag can already publish the
# release assets themselves. Operators who want the stricter form set
# LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_COSIGN_IDENTITY to the exact identity.

# ---------- stale `loom-*` entry-point check (#4079 hardening, #4557) ---------
#
# THE INCIDENT THIS EXISTS FOR (#4079, the direct motivation for epic #4081):
# a `pip install -e loom-tools` from months earlier had left FROZEN console
# scripts in ~/.local/bin. Those scripts outlived the Python package: they kept
# shadowing the Rust `loom-daemon` binary's own PATH entry points, so operators
# and agents silently ran ancient logic while `loom-daemon --version` reported a
# fresh build. Epic #4081 Phase 4 (#4557) deleted the Python package outright,
# which makes every surviving `loom-*` pip console script pure hazard: nothing
# regenerates or updates them ever again.
#
# This check itself is a WARNING ONLY, on every ordinary run. It never deletes
# anything, never mutates PATH, and never changes this script's exit code — an
# operator's ~/.local/bin is theirs, and a false positive must not block an
# update. Opt out entirely with LOOM_SKIP_STALE_ENTRY_POINT_CHECK=1.
#
# The warning used to be the end of the story: it fired on every single run,
# forever, and nothing ever removed what it found (#5139) — an operator had to
# `rm` each path by hand, and a fresh host doing so once would still get warned
# again next run if it missed one (observed on loom-worker-1: removing the
# first batch surfaced two more). `--prune-stale-entry-points` (below) closes
# that gap: an explicit, opt-in, standalone action that removes EXACTLY the
# entries this check classifies as a "Python console script (stale pip/pipx
# editable install)" — reusing the same classification helpers the warning
# uses (_lde_shim_target / _lde_describe), never reimplementing it. A stale
# SHIM (an auto-generated loom-clean/loom-recover-orphans/loom-claim wrapper
# whose sibling loom-daemon moved) is reported by the warning too but is
# deliberately NOT a prune candidate — it is a legitimate wrapper that needs
# re-provisioning, not deletion, and this script has no way to tell "moved" from
# "an operator is mid-migration". `loom-daemon` itself and any allowlisted
# entry are excluded up front, the same as the warning.
#
# A `loom-*` PATH entry is considered LEGITIMATE when it is either:
#   1. `loom-daemon` itself (the native binary), or
#   2. one of the auto-generated PATH shims provision-daemon.sh installs
#      (`loom-clean`, `loom-recover-orphans`, `loom-claim` — #4272/#4275), whose
#      sibling `loom-daemon` resolves to the SAME binary this script resolved.
# Anything else is reported — including a `loom-search` executable, now that
# #4970 retired that package too (see defaults/docs/semantic-search.md): it
# is no longer a legitimate console script, just a frozen entry point from a
# deleted package, exactly the #4079 failure shape.

#   - A byte/checksum compare of the destination is NOT usable either:
#     provision_machine_daemon() calls sign_daemon_binary() on the DESTINATION,

# short-circuit compares — so this assertion also proves that short-circuit
# did not silently no-op a real roll.

# These helpers classify which shape applies so the abort message can name
# (or, with --auto-resolve-safe-abort, perform) the exact safe resolution
# instead of a bare "resolve manually".
#
# Safety note: this is the safety-critical branch of loom-daemon-update.sh —
# #4381 was a live incident where an update-script code path silently
# overwrote a real production binary; the same "automation quietly does
# something destructive to real machine state" risk applies here. Do NOT

# empty-diff check that misses a rename/mode-only change) beyond exactly
# what's specified in #4951 — when genuinely unsure, both helpers must

# form with no rename-detection flags, matching the incident's own manual
# check (`git diff origin/main...main`); `git diff --quiet` also treats a
# mode-only change as non-empty, which is the conservative (safe) direction.
#
# Only meaningful when local <default> has commit(s) NOT reachable from
# origin/<default> (a genuine history divergence) — the `--is-ancestor` guard
# below is load-bearing, not an optimization: when local <default> IS an
# ancestor of origin/<default> (the far more common shape: origin simply
# advanced and local added no commits of its own), the three-dot form trivially
# reduces to diffing local HEAD against itself (merge-base == local HEAD),
# which is ALWAYS empty regardless of what origin changed — so without this
# guard, every plain "blocked by a dirty tracked file" ff-abort (managed or
# not) would misclassify as content-identical and risk an incorrect
# `reset --hard` under --auto-resolve-safe-abort. In that ancestor case the ff
# failure is necessarily a dirty/conflicting working-tree file instead, which
# the OTHER classifier below is responsible for.
#
# ALSO requires a CLEAN working tree relative to local HEAD: both checks above
# compare only COMMITTED refs, so on their own they say nothing about
# uncommitted work sitting in the working tree. A host can simultaneously have
# (a) diverged local commits that net to zero content diff vs. origin and (b)
# an entirely unrelated dirty tracked file (an operator's manual scratch edit,
# managed or not) — `git merge --ff-only` fails on the history divergence
# alone, so this branch is reached, and without this guard the caller's
# --auto-resolve-safe-abort `git reset --hard origin/<default>` would silently
# discard that file's uncommitted changes. The resolution this classifier
# vouches for is only safe when there is no uncommitted work for it to
# destroy, so ANY dirty tracked file makes us return false and fall through —
# to the managed-dirty classifier below, and failing that to the existing hard

# ---------- re-render + relaunch on a refused restart (#4118) ----------
# The exit-6 fallback USED to tell the operator to `launchctl bootstrap` the

# that caused the refused restart) — bootstrapping it relaunches WITHOUT
# KeepAlive:SuccessfulExit and WITHOUT LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR, so the next roll
# refuses identically, forever. The correct fix is to RE-RENDER the plist via
# loom-daemon-start.sh (which hardcodes the two supervised keys), preserving
# the live plist's autonomy/auth env.
#
# `launchctl bootout` itself no longer needs to be avoided for sweep safety
# (#5081): a bare bootout does not kill in-flight sweeps on a current build —
# see the top-of-file note near #4118 for why. This function still stops the
# old daemon with a graceful SIGTERM rather than calling bootout directly,
# both to avoid double-tearing-down the job (loom-daemon-start.sh's own
# launchd block below already bootouts the loaded job before re-bootstrapping)
# and so a daemon that predates this fix keeps behaving safely either way.
