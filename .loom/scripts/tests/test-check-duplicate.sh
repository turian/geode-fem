# test-check-duplicate.sh - Unit tests for check-duplicate.sh's --issue
# cross-reference probe (issue #4162) and its keyword-similarity scoring
# (issue #4409).
#
# check-duplicate.sh's existing keyword-similarity check answers "has this
# been reported before?" -- it is structurally blind to an OPEN issue that
# *critiques* the target's spec (a cross-reference in its body) without being
# textually similar. This mirrors a real incident (rjwalters/repo #32/#33):
# #33 named #32 three times in its body, arguing #32's acceptance criteria
# were wrong, but was never surfaced because it wasn't a *duplicate* -- it
# was a *related, spec-changing* piece of open work.
#
# `check-duplicate.sh --issue N` closes this gap by querying GitHub's
# timeline API for open issues/PRs that cross-reference N, emitting a
# RELATED_OPEN_WORK block distinct from DUPLICATE_FOUND. This is a
# black-box test: check-duplicate.sh is a full CLI script (main "$@" at
# EOF, not sourced functions), so we stub `gh` and `loom-daemon` on PATH and
# invoke the real script as a subprocess, asserting on stdout/exit code.
#
# Issue #4409 fixed two compounding bugs in calculate_similarity(): (1) `read
# -ra arr <<< "$multiline_str"` only ever consumes ONE line, so a multi-keyword
# (i.e. any realistically-worded) title/body collapsed to a single-element
# array -- comparisons became a coin flip on one token instead of a real set
# comparison; (2) even with arrays populated correctly, normalizing by the
# SMALLER set saturated near 100% whenever a large query keyword set was
# compared against a small candidate set. The tests below use small,
# hand-built keyword sets (plain English words, no stopwords) run through the
# real CLI against a stubbed candidate pool, so the resulting percentages are
# exact and checkable by hand (see comments at each candidate).

# together on ONE line ("#801: ... (similarity: 100%)PR #901: ..."). Text
# output was merely garbled; --json was worse, parsing the spliced pair as a
# single match whose title swallowed the second entry and whose number was
# lost. Exercised here with no rate-limiting at all, so it pins the plain
# multi-pool aggregation path independently of the #4526 fallback.
