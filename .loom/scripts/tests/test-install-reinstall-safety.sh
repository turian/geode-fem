# test-install-reinstall-safety.sh - Regression tests for issue #4188
# ("Harvest (fork #55): harden installer reinstall safety + target-aware
# setup-mcp.sh"), ported from gpeyton/loom commit f064aeef.
#
# Covers the installer-safety findings that remain in scope on this repo's
# restructured installer (see issue #4188 for the full harvest triage):
#   1. --quick / --yes / --full must not silently bypass the
#      destructive-reinstall acknowledgement gate -- a non-interactive
#      reinstall over an existing .loom/ install now requires
#      --confirm-reinstall (install.sh).
#   2. Quick Install must rebuild the loom-daemon binary when the source
#      tree is newer than the binary on disk, not just when it's absent
#      (install.sh::loom_daemon_binary_stale).
#   3. `scripts/uninstall-loom.sh --local`'s staging step must only stage
#      Loom-managed paths, not unrelated untracked/staged consumer files
#      sitting in the working tree (already landed via the #3545 work --
#      this group is a regression guard, not new behavior).
#
# Two groups present in the original fork commit are intentionally NOT
# ported here:
#   - is_legacy_rjwalters_install() metadata-first detection: the function
#     does not exist on this repo's restructured installer;
#     install-metadata.json is already written and consumed as authoritative
#     (install.sh's TARGET_PATH/.loom detection), so there is nothing left to
#     regression-test under that name.
#   - Hook-dedup quote-normalization (scaffolding.rs): split out to #4200,
#     tracked as a Rust unit test there.
#
# Strategy: install.sh's loom_daemon_binary_stale() is pure and side-effect
# free, so it is extracted via awk (same pattern as
# test-install-source-guard.sh) and exercised in an isolated harness rather
# than running the full installer end-to-end. The --confirm-reinstall gate
# and the uninstall staging scope are tested by actually invoking
# install.sh / uninstall-loom.sh against throwaway temp git repos.
#
# Usage:
#   bash defaults/scripts/tests/test-install-reinstall-safety.sh
