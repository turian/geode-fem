# test-worktree-remove.sh - Tests for the `worktree.sh remove <N>` verb (#3769)
#
# Verifies the operator-facing single-worktree removal verb:
#   1. Removing a .loom-managed worktree succeeds (dir gone, unregistered,
#      local branch deleted).
#   2. Removing a worktree lacking the .loom-managed sentinel is refused
#      (dir untouched, non-zero exit, clear stderr message).
#   3. Removing a non-existent issue worktree is an idempotent no-op success.
#   4. --keep-branch leaves the local branch intact after removal.
#   5. Running `remove` from a shell whose cwd is inside the target worktree
#      completes successfully (script cd's out first — no shell corruption).
#   6. A worktree with uncommitted changes is REFUSED (#4449): non-zero exit,
#      worktree + work intact, message lists what it found and how to proceed.
#   7. The same worktree removes cleanly with an explicit --force.
#   8. Loom runtime markers (.loom-managed et al) do NOT count as uncommitted
#      work — otherwise the guard would refuse every managed worktree in a repo
#      whose .gitignore predates #3838.
#   9. A staged-only (index) change also triggers the refusal.
#
# Follows the throwaway-repo harness pattern in test-worktree-sentinel.sh:
# a bare origin remote + a working repo, with worktree.sh + its lib/ helpers
# copied into a temp tree, then the script driven directly.
