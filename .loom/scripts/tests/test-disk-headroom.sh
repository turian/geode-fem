# test-disk-headroom.sh — Tests for the resource-gated wave-size helper (#3566)
#
# Covers defaults/scripts/lib/disk-headroom.sh:
#
#   1. loom_wave_size_from_disk — pure integer clamping across the whole matrix
#      (daemon vs subagent target, disk-bound, target-bound, candidate-bound,
#      floor-of-1), plus the reason token and env-tunable PER_WORKTREE_GB.
#   2. loom_worktree_root_free_gb — GB conversion with a stubbed df on PATH.
#   3. loom_worktree_root_free_gb — with LOOM_WORKTREE_ROOT pointed at a scratch
#      tmpdir, proves the helper df's the RESOLVED worktree root (the scratch
#      volume), not the repo drive. Regression guard for the core #3566 AC.
#
# Pattern follows test-worktree-root-override.sh: throwaway dirs in mktemp, a
# df stub on PATH, assert-style harness.
