# test-cleanup-branches-pr-review-branch.sh - Tests for the pr-* review-branch
# cleanup pass added to cleanup-branches.sh (#4405)
#
# Judge/Doctor review-time branches (e.g. a bare `gh pr checkout` outside a
# managed worktree, or a scratch `-v2` iteration) never match
# `feature/issue-*`, so cleanup-branches.sh's original loop never saw them —
# they accumulated forever because a squash-merge repo can never classify
# them via `git branch --merged`. cleanup-branches.sh now additionally
# discovers branches shaped like `pr-<N>` / `pr<N>-*` / `pr-<N>-*`, resolves
# each to its originating PR, and deletes it only when that PR's state is
# MERGED or CLOSED — reusing merge-pr.sh's tip-SHA-verified
# `_maybe_delete_local_branch` helper rather than a raw `git branch -D`.
#
# Verifies:
#   1. Source contains the pr-* discovery regex and the PR-state gate.
#   2. Behavioral, end-to-end run of the REAL cleanup-branches.sh against a
#      throwaway git repo with a stubbed `gh`/forge on PATH:
#      (a) a pr-<N>-style branch whose PR is MERGED gets deleted.
#      (b) a pr-<N>-style branch whose PR is still OPEN is left alone.
#      (c) a feature/issue-<N> branch is processed by the pre-existing path
#          only — unaffected by the new pr-* pass (no double-processing).
#      (d) --dry-run reports the merged-PR branch as "would delete" without
#          actually deleting it.
#      (e) a merged-PR branch that is still checked out in a LINKED worktree
#          exercises _maybe_delete_local_branch's delete-refusal path (which
#          calls _find_worktree_by_branch / _is_primary_worktree_path): the
#          run must not abort, the branch must be kept, and the remaining
#          branches must still be processed.
#      (f) a merged-PR branch that is the PRIMARY checkout's own HEAD takes
#          _is_primary_worktree_path's specialized remediation path (which
#          also reads $DEFAULT_BRANCH_NAME) without aborting.
#      (g) a CLOSED-issue feature/issue-* branch checked out in a LINKED
#          worktree: the pre-existing feature loop's raw `git branch -D`
#          refuses, and under `set -e` a bare delete would abort the whole
#          script before the new pr-* pass runs. The run must exit 0, still
#          print the pr-* pass header, and still clean a later merged-PR
#          pr-* branch (#4405 third-pass regression).
#
# Companion to test-merge-pr-local-branch-cleanup.sh, which tests
# `_maybe_delete_local_branch` itself (the safety check this script reuses).
