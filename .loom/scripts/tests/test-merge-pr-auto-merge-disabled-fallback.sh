# test-merge-pr-auto-merge-disabled-fallback.sh - Unit tests for the repo-level
# "Allow auto-merge disabled" fallback in merge-pr.sh (#3763).
#
# When a repository's "Allow auto-merge" setting is OFF, GitHub rejects the
# enablePullRequestAutoMerge mutation with the error string:
#
#     gh: Auto merge is not allowed for this repository
#
# This is a STATIC, repo-level condition — distinct from the PR-state-level
# "is in clean status" (#3371) and "is in unstable status" (#3486/#3664/#3678)
# rejections that merge-pr.sh already special-cases. Before #3763 the new
# rejection matched neither existing grep, so the script fell through to the
# generic terminal error and aborted — even when the PR was immediately
# mergeable (the reported failure: a CLEAN, Judge-approved PR that could have
# merged synchronously).
#
# The #3763 fallback matches the new error string and then re-checks the PR's
# mergeability with a fresh (uncached) fetch:
#   - .mergeable == "true"  -> flip to the synchronous immediate-merge path
#                              (AUTO_MERGE=false, AUTO_MERGE_OK=true, break).
#   - otherwise             -> preserve the existing terminal error (no silent
#                              bypass of a genuine merge blocker).
#
# This test exercises two surfaces:
#   1. The trigger-string matcher (grep) is correct and mutually exclusive with
#      the CLEAN/UNSTABLE matchers — it fires only on the auto-merge-disabled
#      error and never on the clean/unstable fixtures (and vice versa).
#   2. The mergeability-gated decision policy: fires only when .mergeable is
#      "true", preserves the terminal error otherwise. We replicate the same
#      predicate shape merge-pr.sh uses so the script and the test stay in
#      lockstep, plus assert the script source actually wires the fallback.
