# test-sweep-pr-mode.sh - Smoke tests for /sweep PR-set mode (Mode C, #3384).
#
# /sweep is a markdown skill (prose-engineered), so these tests are
# documentation-shape checks: they verify the skill file contains the
# required Mode C structure, the Mode A/B/C classifier rules, the
# PR-set dry-run output format, and the load-bearing constraints from
# #3289 / #3298 / #3373.
#
# Run from anywhere — uses an absolute path to the skill file via the
# script's own directory.
