# test-merge-pr-auto-reconcile.sh - Unit tests for the automated stacked-PR
# reconciliation trigger in merge-pr.sh (#3747, stacked-PR v2 item 1).
#
# When a stacked PARENT PR (branch feature/issue-<N>) squash-merges, merge-pr.sh
# now discovers open CHILD PRs based on the parent branch via a LIVE forge query
# (`gh pr list --base <parent>`, never the daemon registry) and, per child:
#   - Safe   (child issue NOT loom:building): invokes reconcile-stack.sh.
#   - Unsafe (child issue still loom:building): skips the rebase and posts a
#     deferred-reconciliation comment on the child PR instead.
# The whole step is best-effort and must never fail the parent merge, and it is
# a no-op for non-feature/issue-N parent branches and non-GitHub forges.
#
# Strategy (mirrors test-merge-pr-partial-increment.sh): the functions under
# test (_auto_reconcile_stacked_children and _reconcile_one_stacked_child) depend
# only on globals (PR_BRANCH, REPO_NWO, FORGE_TYPE, SCRIPT_DIR), the `gh` CLI, and
# an invocation of $SCRIPT_DIR/reconcile-stack.sh. We extract the function
# definitions from merge-pr.sh and source them, stub `gh` on PATH to serve canned
# issue JSON / child-PR lists and record mutating calls, point SCRIPT_DIR at a
# stub reconcile-stack.sh that records its args, then assert on the recorded
# calls. Extracting from source (rather than replicating) keeps the test in
# lockstep with the script.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-merge-pr-auto-reconcile.sh

# SC2034: several globals (PR_BRANCH, REPO_NWO, FORGE_TYPE, SCRIPT_DIR) are read
# only by the functions extracted+sourced from merge-pr.sh, which shellcheck
# cannot see — every such assignment looks "unused" to the linter.
