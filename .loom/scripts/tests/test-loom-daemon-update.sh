# test-loom-daemon-update.sh — Tests for loom-daemon-update.sh (Issue #3968).
#
# Focus: (1) staleness detection (--check, built-commit vs. source-HEAD
# comparison), (2) flag preservation across a rebuild+restart (the persisted
# .loom/.daemon.flags file must be replayed verbatim, never widened), and
# (3) the "was not running -> do not start" / --no-restart / --dry-run
# guardrails that keep the FLAGS-OFF/opt-in contract intact.
#
# Style matches test-loom-daemon-start.sh — plain bash, hand-rolled
# assertions, no bats.
#
# Strategy: build a throwaway repo root (temp dir) with a real `.git`, a
# stub `loom-daemon/Cargo.toml`, real copies of loom-daemon-start.sh /
# loom-daemon-stop.sh (so the restart path exercises the actual scripts, not
# a mock), a FAKE `cargo` on PATH that "builds" by copying a prepared fake
# daemon binary into target/release/ instead of actually compiling Rust, and
# FAKE daemon binaries whose `--version` output embeds a controllable commit
# and whose normal-run mode records the autonomy env vars it inherited to a
# marker file before looping (staying "alive" for PID-liveness checks).
#
# Usage:
#   ./defaults/scripts/tests/test-loom-daemon-update.sh

# Production-binary checksum guard (#4381 incident): 2026-07-29 ~06:03Z, the
# REAL machine-level `~/.local/bin/loom-daemon` was overwritten with a fake,
# infinitely-looping test-fixture stub for ~9 hours (an operator `status` poll
# hung; a crash at any point would have had launchd relaunch the stub). Root
# cause: three tests below (37/39/43, the ff-sync/staleness-detection cases)
# deliberately invoke loom-daemon-update.sh with NEITHER LOOM_DAEMON_BIN NOR a
# stubbed scripts/install/provision-daemon.sh, so the update script's
# provision_machine_daemon() call fell through to its real, un-sandboxed
# default destination (`${LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR:-$HOME/.local/bin}`) — the
# operator's own real $HOME. The LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR export below (threaded to
# every sub-invocation) is the actual fix; THIS checksum snapshot is the
# regression backstop that fails the suite outright if any current or future
# test call site regresses into writing the real production binary, even if
# the sandboxing above is bypassed or a new call site is added without it.
# Recorded before ANYTHING else runs, using the checksum tool most likely
# present (sha256sum on Linux, shasum on macOS); skipped (empty) only when
# neither is on PATH or no binary exists yet at that path (nothing to compare
# against — a fresh-machine first run).

# reaches the REAL /usr/bin/systemctl and `is_linux_systemd` (lib/systemd-user.sh)
# returns true whenever the runner has a reachable `systemctl --user` manager.
# That made the suite non-hermetic AND non-terminating in CI:
#
#   1. scenario 5's real loom-daemon-start.sh took the systemd branch and ran
#      `systemctl --user enable --now loom-daemon.service` -- the DEFAULT unit
#      name, i.e. the operator's/runner's real user unit, plus a real
#      `loom-daemon-watchdog.timer` (provision_watchdog_job_systemd derives its
#      name from the daemon unit, NOT from the sandboxed LOOM_WATCHDOG_LABEL).
#   2. every LATER scenario then saw `systemd_unit_loaded` == true, so
#      loom-daemon-update.sh resolved DAEMON_MANAGER=systemd and took the
#      supervised-restart branch: `"$PROVISION_TARGET" restart`.
#   3. PROVISION_TARGET is the fake-daemon fixture, which has no `restart`
#      handler -- so it fell straight into its `while true; do sleep 1; done`
#      daemon body IN THE FOREGROUND and never returned. Scenario 5b wedged
#      there for the full 1200s per-suite CI budget (exit 124).
#
# A macOS dev run never exercises any of this (no systemctl), which is exactly
# why the suite passed locally in ~4m and hung in CI. The systemd-specific
# scenarios (26-34) opt back in explicitly with LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD=1 alongside
# their LOOM_SYSTEMD_FORCE=1 seam and their own stub `systemctl` on PATH.

# this fixture (no `restart` handler) looped instead of answering. So the
# catch-all below exits non-zero for any unrecognized NON-FLAG first argument
# (a real daemon rejects an unknown subcommand; it does not daemonize). A
# leading `-`/`--` still falls through to the daemon body, because the

#                          the live path and rewrites it under a running

# step is `harvest_plist_env` (lib/daemon-env-harvest.sh) -- which requires
# plutil + jq by contract ("required on the macOS launchd path") and returns 2
# when either is missing, so perform_relaunch aborts with 6 and never
# re-renders the plist. Scenario 22 then reads the result back with
# `plutil -extract` directly. Everything else launchd-flavored in this suite
# runs off the stub `launchctl`/`uname` pair and IS portable; these two are

#     `~/.loom/tokens` exists (the token pool `loom-daemon tokens bootstrap`
#     provisions), so the old `.loom`-only upward walk matched $HOME on its

#     ~/.loom is never mistaken for a checkout), and the script falls back to
#     the checkout it physically lives in, which is unambiguous when it is
#     invoked by absolute path.

# 56b. THE #5119 INCIDENT (2026-08-03 loom-worker-1): systemd restart ack'd, the
#      daemon exited 0, but on a busy host the unit sat in
#      `deactivating (stop-sigterm)` while systemd reaped the sweep/role children
#      still in the cgroup — long past the #4950 pid poll on a stale unit's 90s
#      TimeoutStopSec. The pre-#5119 code read ActiveState once, saw
#      `deactivating` (not yet `failed`), and "refused to guess" -> exit 7, daemon
#      left DOWN. Under #5119 the updater WAITS for the stop to settle (here it
#      lands in `failed`, Result=timeout — the classic escalation) and then
#      reset-failed+start RECOVERS it -> exit 0, no manual intervention. This is
#      the acceptance-criteria scenario for the issue.

#    that "ran" could still be trusting anything.
