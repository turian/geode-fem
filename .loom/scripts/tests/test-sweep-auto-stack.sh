# test-sweep-auto-stack.sh - Doc-shape tests for /sweep --auto-stack (issue #3759).
#
# /sweep is a markdown skill (prose-engineered), so these tests are
# documentation-shape checks: they verify the skill file documents the
# opt-in --auto-stack flag, the same-candidate-set body-text edge
# detection, the linear/single-parent + cycle guards, the confirmation
# gate reuse, the wave-ordering pass, and the per-issue DEPENDS_ON[N]
# generalization of the shipped --depends-on mechanics (#3729/#3747/#3752).
#
# The load-bearing guard here is the "same-candidate-set only" restriction:
# a future edit must not silently broaden detection to arbitrary external
# issues. That is asserted explicitly below.
#
# Run from anywhere — uses an absolute path to the skill file via the
# script's own directory.
