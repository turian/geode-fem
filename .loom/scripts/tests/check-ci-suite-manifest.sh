#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-ci-suite-manifest.sh — enforce the wired/excluded partition invariant
# for defaults/scripts/tests/ (issue #4455).
#
# Invariant: every `test-*.sh` in this directory appears in EXACTLY ONE of
#   - ci-wired.txt    (run by run-ci-suites.sh in CI), or
#   - ci-excluded.txt (explicitly excluded, with a required one-line reason).
#
# This is the forcing function that keeps the coverage gap from regrowing: a
# newly added suite that is in NEITHER list fails this check, so a contributor
# must consciously wire it or exclude-it-with-a-reason. The `lib/` helper
# directory is intentionally ignored — only `test-*.sh` files are suites.
#
# Since #4769 the invariant also covers tests/hooks/ (repo root) — the
# Claude-path guard suites. Since #4451 it also covers defaults/hooks/tests/
# (the Repo Skills' own guard-hook suites — background-subagents,
# loom-workspace, worktree-paths, methodology-inject, skill-router). Since
# #5275 it also covers tests/install/ (installer/uninstaller unit suites) and
# tests/hermit/ (the Hermit role's stateless-ceremony heuristic regression
# guard) -- both were previously orphaned (no CI runner at all). Entries for
# any external directory are qualified with their path relative to the repo
# root (e.g. `tests/hooks/test-guard-destructive.sh`,
# `defaults/hooks/tests/test-skill-router.sh`,
# `tests/install/test-forge-detect.sh`) so they can't collide with a
# same-named suite in this directory.
#
# Exit 0 = invariant holds; exit 1 = violation (details printed to stderr).
