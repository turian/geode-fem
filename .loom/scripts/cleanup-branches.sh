# Loom Branch Cleanup Script - Remove feature branches for closed issues, and
# review-time PR branches for merged/closed PRs.
#
# This script automatically cleans up stale local branches:
#   1. `feature/issue-<N>` branches for issues that are confirmed CLOSED.
#   2. `pr-<N>` / `pr<N>-*` / `pr-<N>-*` review-time branches (left behind by
#      Judge/Doctor sessions that checked out a PR outside a managed worktree,
#      e.g. `pr-4372`, `pr-4372-v2`, `pr4396-review`) for PRs that are
#      confirmed MERGED or CLOSED (#4405). Because this repo squash-merges,
#      `git branch --merged` can never classify these — they must be
#      cross-checked against the forge's PR state instead.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/cleanup-branches.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Options:
#   --dry-run    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
#
# Safety:
#   - Only deletes feature/issue-* branches for confirmed CLOSED issues
#   - Only deletes pr-* review branches for confirmed MERGED/CLOSED PRs,
#     reusing merge-pr.sh's tip-SHA-verified `_maybe_delete_local_branch`
#     helper (never a raw `git branch -D`)
#   - Preserves branches for OPEN issues/PRs
#   - Provides summary of actions taken
