# resolve-model.sh - Thin stub delegating to `loom-daemon resolve-model` (#3982)
#
# Ported from Python to native Rust in issue #4275 (epic #4081 Phase 3 family
# 5); flag names, stdout shape and exit codes are unchanged.
#
# The /loom:sweep skill shells out to this to resolve a *logical* model tier
# (`opus`, `sonnet`, `sonnet@xhigh`) to the concrete model ID it should dispatch
# on the wire, BEFORE it passes the model to a subagent Task. This is the single
# indirection point that fixes the non-monotonic escalation ladder: every rung,
# the tier-2.5 bump, the Judge/refusal fallbacks, and the experiment's Arm A keep
# naming the alias `opus`, and exactly one place decides that `opus` means
# `claude-opus-5` (the CLI's own `opus` alias still resolves to a gen-4 model).
#
# The mapping is configurable in `.loom/config.json` -> `sweep.modelAliases`, so
# an operator can repoint a tier (or drop the pin once the CLI alias rolls to
# gen-5) with no code change. Unknown aliases and pinned IDs (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
# pass through unchanged.
#
# Usage:
#   resolve-model.sh <tier|alias|id>            # prints the resolved model ID
#   resolve-model.sh <tier> --generation        # prints the resolved generation number
#   resolve-model.sh <model|id> --task-alias    # prints the nearest Task-tool alias
#   resolve-model.sh <tier> --config <path>     # explicit .loom/config.json path
#
# Examples:
#   resolve-model.sh opus            # -> claude-opus-5
#   resolve-model.sh sonnet@xhigh    # -> sonnet@xhigh   (passthrough; CLI resolves)
#   resolve-model.sh claude-sonnet-4-6   # -> claude-sonnet-4-6 (pinned ID, unchanged)
#   resolve-model.sh claude-opus-5 --task-alias   # -> opus (Task-tool degradation, #4282)
#
# --task-alias (issue #4282): the daemon/process path passes a resolved model as
# `--model <id>` (pinned IDs OK), but the in-session Task/Agent tool's `model`
# parameter is an alias-only enum (sonnet|opus|haiku|fable) — a pinned ID is
# invalid there. --task-alias maps a resolved model back to its nearest Task-passable
# alias (`claude-opus-5` -> `opus`; @effort stripped), so the in-session dispatch
# degradation is a deterministic lookup, not per-orchestrator judgement. Exits 3
# with no output when there is no Task-passable alias (caller omits `model`).
