# recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh - Detect and recover orphaned task state.
#
# Delegates to the native `loom-daemon recover-orphans` subcommand (issue
# #4272, epic #4081 Phase 3 family 2 — a byte-compatible Rust port of the
# historical Python `loom-recover-orphans` CLI). A capability probe still
# detects a daemon binary that predates the `recover-orphans` subcommand (a
# host mid-roll), but there is NO fallback to fall back to: PR #4301 (commit
# dba33666) deleted `loom_tools/orphan_recovery.py` and its
# `loom-recover-orphans` console-script entry in the very same commit that
# added the probe, so the old `run_loom_tool` branch could only ever produce
# `No module named loom_tools.orphan_recovery`. A stale binary now fails
# loudly with a rebuild remedy instead (#4384).
#
# The script name is preserved for back-compat with operator muscle memory
# and any CLAUDE.md / docs that link to it.
#
# Usage:
#   recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh              # Dry-run: show what would be recovered
#   recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh --recover    # Actually recover orphaned state
#   recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh --json       # Output JSON for programmatic use
#   recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh --verbose    # Show detailed progress
#   recover-orphaned-shepherds.sh --help       # Show help
