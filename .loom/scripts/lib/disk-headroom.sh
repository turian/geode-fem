# disk-headroom.sh — Resource-gated wave-size math for /loom:sweep (#3566).
#
# Source this file (do not exec). It defines two functions used by the sweep
# skill's Stage -1 "Resolve auto wave size" step:
#
#   loom_worktree_root_free_gb <repo_root>
#       Resolve the worktree-root filesystem (via loom_worktree_root) and echo
#       the integer free space on THAT volume in GB. This is the dedicated
#       scratch volume when LOOM_WORKTREE_ROOT / worktree.root is set (#3539,
#       #3541) — NOT the repo's own drive.
#
#   loom_wave_size_from_disk <mechanism> <candidate_count> <free_gb>
#       Pure integer arithmetic (no I/O). Given the chosen parallelism
#       mechanism, the number of candidate issues, and the free GB on the
#       scratch volume, echo the clamped wave size on line 1 and a machine
#       reason token on line 2. Deterministic and trivially unit-testable.
#
# Two mechanisms, two targets (see #3566, #3289, #3693):
#   - daemon   → detached-process path (mcp__loom__dispatch_sweep). Each sweep
#                is its own OS process with its own rotated token, so the #3289
#                nested-subagent stall does not apply. Scales toward N=10.
#   - subagent → in-session Task subagents, one level deep. The #3289 stall is
#                specifically a *nested*-dispatch hazard (the stream pump dies on
#                parallel grandchildren, parent → /shepherd → builder), which
#                /sweep never does — it dispatches builders/judges directly, one
#                level deep. WIDTH at one level deep is instead bounded by the
#                harness concurrency cap (min(16, cores-2)), so the subagent
#                default now CORE-SCALES within [3, 6] via
#                loom_subagent_target_from_cores() (#3693) rather than sitting at
#                a flat 3. The ceiling stays 6 (NOT 8/10): a single account's
#                weekly rate limit and the orchestrator's context-window pressure
#                (every wave member's Task result is read back into the SAME
#                session) both argue for a conservative width below the
#                daemon-path target. NEVER raise this ceiling toward 10 — route
#                true high parallelism through the daemon path instead. The #3289
#                "one level deep" NESTING rule is untouched by this scaling.
#
# Constants (all overridable via env for large-repo / tuning cases):
#   LOOM_PER_WORKTREE_GB   default 2   Conservative per-worktree disk estimate.
#                                      A fixed estimate keeps the math pure and
#                                      testable; runtime footprint measurement
#                                      is intentionally out of scope for v1.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_WAVE_TARGET  default 10  Concurrency target for the daemon path.
#   LOOM_SUBAGENT_WAVE_CAP   default: core-scaled clamp(floor((cores-2)/4), 3, 6)
#                                      #3289-safe subagent-path target (#3693).
#                                      An explicit env value always overrides the
#                                      core-scaled default.
#   LOOM_CORES_OVERRIDE      unset      Force a specific core count for
#                                      deterministic testing/tuning of
#                                      loom_detect_cores.
#
# Reason tokens emitted on line 2 of loom_wave_size_from_disk (which constraint
# bound the result):
#   target      — result equals the mechanism target; nothing reduced it.
#   candidates  — reduced by the candidate count (fewer issues than the target).
#   disk        — reduced by scratch-volume disk headroom.
#   floor       — the math produced < 1 (e.g. a nearly full disk); floored to 1.

# Resolve worktree-root.sh relative to this file so sourcing works from any cwd.
#
# ${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0} is a bash+zsh-portable self-path idiom (#3680). This file
# is unique among defaults/scripts/lib/*.sh in that sweep.md's Stage -1 sources it
# DIRECTLY into the invoking shell (`source ./.loom/scripts/lib/disk-headroom.sh`),
# which on macOS is often zsh (Claude Code's Bash tool runs zsh; zsh is also the
# interactive default). Under zsh, BASH_SOURCE is unset, so bare ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
# -> "" and dirname "" -> ".", resolving worktree-root.sh against the shell's CWD
# (repo root) instead of this lib dir — the source then fails. zsh sets $0 to the
# sourced file's path, so the :-$0 fallback recovers it; bash keeps using
# BASH_SOURCE[0] unchanged. Every other lib file is only sourced from within
# bash-shebang'd scripts that are executed (not sourced into the top-level shell),
# so BASH_SOURCE is always populated for them and they need no change. See the
# audit table on #3680 for the full file-by-file disposition.

# loom_worktree_root_free_gb <repo_root>

# does not exist yet, so this walks up to the nearest existing ancestor before
# calling df — df on a non-existent path errors. df -Pk forces the portable
# POSIX 512-independent 1024-byte-block output (macOS df differs from GNU df;
# -P pins the single-line-per-fs columnar format, -k pins 1K blocks), and the
# 4th column of the data row is "Available" in 1K blocks.
#
# Unknown != zero (#4164): on ANY failure to actually measure free space —
# missing argument, an unresolvable worktree root, a failing/malformed `df` —
# this prints NOTHING on stdout and returns non-zero, with a stderr message
# naming the probed path. A genuine measurement of 0 free bytes (a truly full
# disk) still prints "0" with exit 0 — real disk pressure must stay
# distinguishable from a broken probe. Callers (sweep.md Stage -1) MUST check
# the exit status rather than assuming a printed value.
