#!/usr/bin/env bash
# generate-agents-md.sh — generate defaults/.loom/AGENTS.md from the
# `agents-md:include` marker ranges in defaults/.loom/CLAUDE.md.
#
# Why (#4479, epic #4167 pillar 3): AGENTS.md is the cross-runtime instruction
# anchor (an Agentic AI Foundation / Linux Foundation standard read natively by
# OpenAI Codex CLI and others — see https://agents.md). Loom must not maintain a
# second hand-authored instruction file that drifts from CLAUDE.md, so this
# generator EXTRACTS the runtime-neutral repo-orientation content (label
# workflow, worktree rules, merge-pr.sh mandate, REST-vs-GraphQL guidance) that
# already lives in defaults/.loom/CLAUDE.md between `<!-- agents-md:include:start
# -->` / `<!-- agents-md:include:end -->` markers, and wraps it with AGENTS.md-
# specific framing (dual-runtime status + "Claude Code only today" callouts).
# There is exactly one place a human edits the prose: the CLAUDE.md source.
#
# The generated defaults/.loom/AGENTS.md is a CHECKED-IN artifact (same posture
# as defaults/.loom/CLAUDE.md itself: hand-edited inputs, machine-produced and
# committed output). scripts/check-agents-md-sync.sh fails CI if the checked-in
# file is stale relative to its source.
#
# Attribution: the install-time AGENTS.md scaffolding this feeds was seeded by
# the gpeyton/loom fork's PR #8 (AGENTS.md codegen). The fork shipped a
# hand-authored static file; this repo generates the content instead, per
# #4479's single-source non-goal.
#
# Usage:
#   generate-agents-md.sh              Write defaults/.loom/AGENTS.md (canonical)
#   generate-agents-md.sh --stdout     Print the generated content to stdout
#   generate-agents-md.sh <path>       Write to <path> instead of the canonical file
#
# Exit codes: 0 = generated; 1 = source missing / empty extraction;
#             2 = malformed or missing include markers in the source.

## Claude Code only today

The coordination mechanics above (labels, worktrees, the sweep lifecycle,
`merge-pr.sh`) are runtime-neutral — any worker that can run `gh` and `git`
participates. These dispatch surfaces are Claude-Code-specific for now:

- **Slash commands** (`/loom:sweep`, `/loom:builder`, `/loom:judge`, …) are
  defined under `.claude/commands/loom/`. A non-Claude runtime cannot invoke
  them by name; it performs the equivalent steps directly (claim the issue,
  create the worktree, implement, open the PR).
- **MCP tools** (`mcp__loom__dispatch_sweep`, `mcp__loom__list_sweeps`, …) are
  reachable only through Claude Code's MCP integration.
- **`PreToolUse` guard hooks** and the **`.loom/tokens/` multi-account token
  pool** guard Claude tool calls and rotate Claude Code credentials — they do
  not apply to other runtimes.

For the full Claude-Code-oriented guide (daemon MCP surface, configuration,
token pool, troubleshooting) see `.loom/CLAUDE.md`.
