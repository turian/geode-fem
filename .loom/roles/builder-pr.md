# Builder: PR Creation and Quality

This document covers PR creation, test output handling, and quality requirements for the Builder role. For the core builder workflow, see `builder.md`.

## Pre-Implementation Review: Check Recent Main Changes

**CRITICAL:** Before implementing, review recent changes to main to avoid conflicts with recent architectural decisions.

### Why This Matters

The codebase evolves while you work. Recent PRs may have:
- Introduced new utilities or helper functions you should use
- Changed authentication/authorization patterns
- Updated API conventions or response formats
- Added shared components or abstractions
- Modified configuration or environment handling

**Without this review**: You may implement using outdated patterns, leading to merge conflicts, inconsistent code, or duplicated functionality.

### Required Commands

**Step 1: Review recent commits to main**

```bash
# Show last 20 commits to main
git fetch origin main
git log --oneline -20 origin/main

# Show files changed in recent commits
git diff HEAD~20..origin/main --stat
```

**Step 2: Check changes in your feature area**

```bash
# Check recent changes in directories related to your feature
git log --oneline -10 origin/main -- "src/relevant/path"
git log --oneline -10 origin/main -- "*.ts"  # or relevant file types
```

**Step 3: Look for these architectural changes**

| Change Type | What to Look For | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | New auth middleware, session handling, token patterns | Use the new auth approach, not old patterns |
| **API Patterns** | Response formats, error handling, validation | Match existing conventions |
| **Utilities** | New helper functions, shared modules | Reuse instead of reimplementing |
| **Shared Components** | Common UI elements, base classes | Extend rather than duplicate |
| **Configuration** | New env vars, config patterns | Follow established patterns |

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# 2. See what changed recently
git log --oneline -20 origin/main
# 5b55cb7 Add dependency unblocking to Guide role (#997)
# cc41f95 Add guidance for handling pre-existing lint/build failures (#982)
# 6b55a3e Add rebase step before PR creation (#980)
# ...

# 3. If you see relevant changes, investigate
git show 5b55cb7 --stat  # See what files changed
git show 5b55cb7          # See the actual changes

# 4. Check changes in your feature area
git log --oneline -10 origin/main -- "src/lib/auth"
# -> If you see auth changes, read them before implementing!

# 5. Adapt your implementation plan based on findings
```

### When to Skip This Step

- **Trivial fixes**: Typos, documentation, obvious bugs
- **Isolated changes**: Changes that don't interact with other code
- **Fresh main**: You just pulled main and no time has passed

### Integration with Worktree Workflow

This review happens BEFORE creating your worktree:

1. Read issue (with comments)
2. **Review recent main changes** (YOU ARE HERE)
3. Check dependencies
4. Create worktree
5. Implement (using patterns learned from review)

## Test Output: Truncate for Token Efficiency

**IMPORTANT**: When running tests, truncate verbose output to conserve tokens in long-running sessions.

### Why Truncate?

Test output can easily exceed 10,000+ lines, consuming significant context:
- Full test suites dump every passing test
- Stack traces repeat for related failures
- Coverage reports add thousands of lines
- This wastes tokens and pollutes context for subsequent work

### Truncation Strategies

**Option 1: Failures + Summary Only (Recommended)**

```bash
# Run tests, capture only failures and summary
pnpm test 2>&1 | grep -E "(FAIL|PASS|Error|Summary|Tests:)" | head -100

# Or use test runner's built-in options
pnpm test --reporter=dot          # Minimal output (dots for pass/fail)
pnpm test --silent                # Suppress console.log from tests
pnpm test --onlyFailures          # Re-run only failed tests
```

**Option 2: Tail for Summary**

```bash
# Get just the final summary
pnpm test 2>&1 | tail -30
```

**Option 3: Head + Tail**

```bash
# First 20 lines (test start) + last 30 lines (summary)
pnpm test 2>&1 | (head -20; echo "... [truncated] ..."; tail -30)
```

**Option 4: Grep for Failures**

```bash
# Show only failing tests and their immediate context
pnpm test 2>&1 | grep -A 5 -B 2 "FAIL\|Error"
```

### When Full Output Is Needed

Sometimes you need full output for debugging:
- First run after major changes (to see all failures)
- Investigating intermittent failures
- Understanding test coverage gaps

In these cases, run full output but don't include it all in your response. Instead:
1. Run the full test suite
2. Analyze the output
3. Report only relevant failures in your response
4. Include actionable summary, not raw dumps

### Example: Good Test Reporting

**Instead of dumping 500 lines of output:**

```
Test Results: 3 failures

1. `src/lib/state.test.ts` - "should update terminal config"
   - Expected: { name: "Builder" }
   - Received: undefined
   - Likely cause: Missing null check in updateTerminal()

2. `src/lib/worktree.test.ts` - "should create worktree"
   - Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory
   - Likely cause: Test cleanup not running

3. `src/main.test.ts` - "should initialize app"
   - Timeout after 5000ms
   - Likely cause: Async setup not awaited

Summary: 47 passed, 3 failed, 50 total
```

This gives you all the information needed to fix issues without wasting tokens on verbose output.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification: REQUIRED Before PR Creation

**CRITICAL:** Before creating a PR, you MUST explicitly verify that ALL acceptance criteria from the issue are met. This prevents incomplete PRs that require manual intervention during review.

### Why This Matters

During orchestration, incomplete PRs cause:
- CI failures when criteria are missed
- Manual intervention mid-workflow
- Wasted review cycles
- Sweep/Judge time spent on fixable issues

**Example failure**: Issue #1441 listed 4 shellcheck warnings to fix. Builder fixed 3/4, missed `cli/loom-start.sh:47`, requiring manual fixes after CI failed.

### Step 1: Extract Acceptance Criteria

Before starting implementation, extract ALL acceptance criteria from the issue:

**Look for these patterns in issue body and comments:**

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Checkbox items | `- [ ] Fix shellcheck warning in file.sh` |
| Numbered requirements | `1. Add validation to input` |
| "must"/"should"/"required" statements | `Must handle edge case X` |
| Explicit test conditions | `Verify that Y works when Z` |
| File-specific changes | `Update config.json to include...` |

**Create a working checklist:**

```markdown
## My Acceptance Criteria Checklist

From issue #123:
- [ ] Fix shellcheck warning in `scripts/build.sh:42`
- [ ] Fix shellcheck warning in `scripts/test.sh:15`
- [ ] Fix shellcheck warning in `scripts/deploy.sh:88`
- [ ] All `find ... -exec shellcheck` returns 0 warnings
```

### Step 2: Verify Each Criterion During Implementation

As you complete each item, explicitly verify it works:

```bash
# Example: Issue says "Fix all shellcheck warnings in scripts/"
# DON'T just fix what you find - verify the COMPLETE list from the issue

# If issue lists specific files:
shellcheck scripts/build.sh    # Check file 1
shellcheck scripts/test.sh     # Check file 2
shellcheck scripts/deploy.sh   # Check file 3
# etc. - check EVERY file mentioned

# If issue says "all shellcheck warnings":
find scripts -name "*.sh" -exec shellcheck {} \; 2>&1 | grep -c "error\|warning"
# Must return 0
```

### Step 3: Pre-PR Verification Checklist

**BEFORE running `gh pr create`, complete this checklist:**

```markdown
## Pre-PR Verification

Issue #123 acceptance criteria:

1. [ ] Criterion A - Verified by: [describe how you checked]
2. [ ] Criterion B - Verified by: [describe how you checked]
3. [ ] Criterion C - Verified by: [describe how you checked]

Root cause verification (for process/behavior issues):
- [ ] Changes address root cause, not just surface symptom
- [ ] Fix is structural (enforcement, validation, inlining) not just documentation
- [ ] If documentation-only: justified why docs will change behavior this time

Local verification:
- [ ] The project's check command passes (see `buildGate.command` in `.loom/config.json`, or the repo's documented CI command, e.g. `pnpm check:ci`)
- [ ] Formatter + linter run on changed files (see "Format and Lint Changed Files" below) — a format-only CI failure is a guaranteed Judge rejection
- [ ] Commits are signed off if required (`commit.signoff: true` in `.loom/config.json`, or a DCO/`sign-off` requirement — `git commit --signoff`; see "DCO sign-off" above)
- [ ] Relevant tests pass
- [ ] Each criterion has explicit verification (not "I think it works")
```

### Step 4: Document Verification in PR Description

Include criterion verification in your PR description:

```markdown
## Summary
Fix shellcheck warnings in deployment scripts.

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criterion | Status | Verification |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Fix `scripts/build.sh:42` | ✅ | `shellcheck scripts/build.sh` returns no warnings |
| Fix `scripts/test.sh:15` | ✅ | `shellcheck scripts/test.sh` returns no warnings |
| Fix `scripts/deploy.sh:88` | ✅ | `shellcheck scripts/deploy.sh` returns no warnings |
| All warnings resolved | ✅ | `find scripts -name "*.sh" -exec shellcheck {} \;` returns 0 |

Closes #123
```

### Common Verification Commands

| Criterion Type | Verification Command |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Shellcheck fixes | `shellcheck <file>` or `find ... -exec shellcheck {} \;` |
| TypeScript errors | `pnpm tsc --noEmit` |
| Lint issues | `pnpm lint` or scoped `biome check <file>` |
| Rust compilation | `cargo check` (see Language-Specific section below) |
| Rust linting | `cargo clippy` (see Language-Specific section below) |
| Rust formatting | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` (see Language-Specific section below) |
| Test passes | `pnpm test -- <pattern>` |
| File exists/content | `cat <file>` or `grep <pattern> <file>` |
| Config changes | Read file and verify expected content |

### Format and Lint Changed Files: MANDATORY Before Committing

**Run the project's formatter and linter on your changed files before every
commit, not just before opening the PR.** A format-only CI failure (e.g. `cargo
fmt --check` / `ruff format --check` / `biome format --check` catching an
unformatted file with otherwise-correct code) is a **guaranteed Judge
rejection** — Judge never approves with a failing required check (see "PR
Creation Checklist" below), so a one-command mechanical fix costs a full
Doctor -> Judge cycle (an extra dispatch, re-review, and CI wait). This
happened repeatedly in production (kicad-tools PRs #4532/#4533/#4535, #4882):
otherwise approve-ready PRs rejected solely on `ruff format --check`.

**Discover the commands from repo convention** — don't skip this because the
language or toolchain is unfamiliar:

1. Check `buildGate.command` in `.loom/config.json` (may already run
   format+lint as part of the project check command).
2. Check `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `package.json` scripts, a `Makefile`, or the CI
   workflow (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) for the documented format/lint
   commands.
3. Fall back to the language's standard tool:

| Language | Format | Lint |
|----------|--------|------|
| Rust | `cargo fmt` | `cargo clippy` |
| Python | `ruff format <files>` (or `black <files>`) | `ruff check <files>` |
| TypeScript/JavaScript | `biome format --write <files>` / `prettier --write <files>` | `biome check <files>` / `eslint <files>` |
| Go | `gofmt -w <files>` | `go vet ./...` |
| Shell | — | `shellcheck <file>` |

**Scope to your changed files** (same pattern as "Handling Pre-existing
Lint/Build Failures" below) so you don't pull unrelated files into your PR:

```bash
# Example: Python project
git diff --name-only origin/main -- '*.py' | xargs -r uv run ruff format
git diff --name-only origin/main -- '*.py' | xargs -r uv run ruff check
```

Add to your pre-PR checklist:
```markdown
Local verification:
- [ ] Formatter run on changed files (no remaining diff / `--check` passes)
- [ ] Linter run on changed files (0 errors)
```

### Language-Specific Verification

**Rust Code Changes**

If you modified any `.rs` files, run these checks **before committing**:

```bash
# Compile check - catches type errors, borrow issues, async Send violations
cargo check

# Lint - catches common mistakes, anti-patterns, correctness issues
cargo clippy

# Format all Rust files (applies formatting)
cargo fmt

# Verify formatting (check only, no changes - returns non-zero if unformatted)
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

**Why check compilation before commit (not just rely on CI)?**

1. **Defense in depth** - Pre-commit hooks can fail silently in worktrees or with PATH issues
2. **Early feedback** - Catch errors immediately instead of after CI failure
3. **Save a Doctor cycle** - the project's check command (`buildGate.command` in `.loom/config.json`, e.g. `pnpm check:ci`) includes compilation; catching it early avoids a fix cycle
4. **Async pitfalls** - Common Rust async errors (e.g., holding `MutexGuard` across `.await`) are only caught by the compiler, not by reading code

**Add to your pre-PR checklist when modifying Rust:**

```markdown
Local verification:
- [ ] The project's check command passes (`buildGate.command` in `.loom/config.json`, e.g. `pnpm check:ci`)
- [ ] `cargo check` returns 0 (Rust files only)
- [ ] `cargo clippy` returns 0 (Rust files only)
- [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check` returns 0 (Rust files only)
```

### Red Flags: Don't Create PR Yet

**STOP and verify if:**
- You haven't explicitly checked each criterion from the issue
- You're unsure if a criterion is met ("it should work")
- The issue mentions files you haven't touched
- CI might fail on something you didn't test locally

**Instead:**
1. Go back to Step 1 and re-extract criteria
2. Verify each one explicitly
3. Only then create the PR

## PR Titles: Conventional Commit Style Required

**CRITICAL:** PR titles MUST describe the actual change. Never use generic or issue-referencing titles.

### Format

```
<type>: <concise summary of what the code change does>
```

### Allowed Prefixes

| Prefix | When to Use |
|--------|------------|
| `fix:` | Bug fixes |
| `feat:` | New features or capabilities |
| `refactor:` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `docs:` | Documentation-only changes |
| `test:` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore:` | Build, config, or tooling changes |
| `perf:` | Performance improvements |

### How to Derive the Title

1. **Look at your diff**, not the issue title — what files changed and what do the changes accomplish?
2. **Pick the correct prefix** based on the nature of the change (bug fix → `fix:`, new capability → `feat:`, etc.)
3. **Summarize the change itself** in a few words — a reader should understand the change without opening the PR
4. **Keep it under 70 characters** total (prefix + description)

**Ask yourself:** "If someone reads only this title in `git log --oneline`, will they understand what changed?" If the answer is no, rewrite it.

### Examples

**WRONG (generic body that just references the issue):**
```
feat: implement changes for issue #2584
fix: address issue #2557
feat: implement feature from issue #123
```

**WRONG (bare issue number):**
```
Issue #2557
```

**WRONG (raw issue title copied as PR title):**
```
Builder should generate descriptive PR titles instead of generic 'Issue #N'
```

**WRONG (double prefix — issue title's own prefix copied and another prefix prepended):**
```
feat: bug: MCP status bar noise misclassifies builder failures as MCP failures
fix: feat: add workspace snapshot caching for daemon state
```

**CORRECT (describes what the code change actually does):**
```
fix: standardize timestamp format to ISO 8601 UTC across log scripts
feat: add workspace snapshot caching for daemon state
refactor: rename instant-exit to low-output terminology
docs: update troubleshooting guide for worktree cleanup
fix: prevent duplicate label transitions in sweep phase validation
```

### Issue Title Prefix Mapping

Issue titles sometimes use non-standard prefixes (like `bug:`) that are **not** valid conventional commit types. If you're tempted to use an issue title as inspiration for your PR title, be aware that you must strip and remap the issue prefix — never copy it verbatim.

| Issue Title Prefix | Correct PR Prefix | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `bug:` | `fix:` | `bug:` is not a conventional commit type |
| `feature:` | `feat:` | Abbreviate to `feat:` |
| `feat:` | `feat:` | Already valid — but still rewrite the description |
| `fix:` | `fix:` | Already valid — but still rewrite the description |
| `docs:` | `docs:` | Already valid — but still rewrite the description |
| `chore:` | `chore:` | Already valid — but still rewrite the description |

**CRITICAL**: Never prepend a new prefix to a title that already has one. `feat: bug: MCP status bar...` is malformed. Instead:
1. Strip the issue title prefix entirely
2. Map to the correct conventional commit type using the table above
3. Rewrite the summary to describe what your **code change does**, not what the issue says

Remember: even if an issue title has a valid prefix, the PR title should describe your diff — not copy the issue title.

### Why This Matters

- `gh pr list`, `git log --oneline`, and release notes become readable at a glance
- Generic titles like "implement changes for issue #N" provide zero information
- Aligns with the existing commit style in this repository
- Enables automated changelog generation

### PR Title Checklist

Before creating a PR, verify your title:
- [ ] Starts with a conventional commit prefix (`fix:`, `feat:`, etc.)
- [ ] Describes what the PR **does**, not what issue it addresses
- [ ] Does NOT contain generic phrases like "implement changes for", "address issue", or "implement feature from"
- [ ] Does NOT reference an issue number in the title (issue references go in the PR body)
- [ ] Does NOT contain double prefixes (e.g., `feat: bug:`, `fix: feat:`) — strip any prefix from the issue title before composing your own
- [ ] Is under 70 characters
- [ ] A reader can understand the change from the title alone without looking at the diff

---

## Commit Messages: Same Rules as PR Titles

Commit messages follow the **exact same rules** as PR titles above. Since this repo uses squash merge, the PR title becomes the final commit on main — but individual commit messages still matter for worktree history and debugging.

### How to Write Commit Messages

```bash
# Step 1: Review your diff BEFORE writing the commit message
git diff --stat
git diff

# Step 2: Describe what the code change does
git commit -m "fix: validate PR title format in sweep phase validation"

# NOT: git commit -m "feat: implement changes for issue #2678"
# NOT: git commit -m "fix: address issue #2557"
```

### Commit Message Anti-Patterns

These patterns are **WRONG** — sweep phase validation will reject PRs with titles matching them:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|-------------|---------------|
| `feat: implement changes for issue #N` | Describes the issue, not the code change |
| `fix: address issue #N` | Says nothing about what was fixed |
| `feat: implement feature from issue #N` | Generic — could be any feature |
| `<copy of issue title>` | Issue titles describe problems; commits describe solutions |

### DCO sign-off

If `commit.signoff` is `true` in `.loom/config.json`, pass `--signoff` on **every**
commit you author (including `git commit --amend`) so each carries a
`Signed-off-by:` trailer — DCO-requiring repos gate PRs on it:

```bash
git commit --signoff -m "fix: validate PR title format in sweep phase validation"
```

If the knob is unset, do a one-time check before your first commit: if
`CONTRIBUTING.md`/a `DCO` file mentions `Signed-off-by`/DCO **or** a required status
check name matches `dco`/`sign-?off`, use `--signoff` too and note it in the PR
body. `--signoff` is harmless when not required. See
`defaults/docs/commit-signoff.md`.

---

## Creating Pull Requests: Label and Auto-Close Requirements

> **CRITICAL**: PRs MUST include an issue reference in the body — either a closing keyword
> (`Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N`) for a full implementation, or a non-closing
> reference (`Part of #N` / `Contributes to #N`) for a declared **partial increment** of a
> family/epic issue (see "Partial increments" below).
> A closing keyword is required for:
> 1. GitHub to auto-close the issue when the PR merges
> 2. **Sweep orchestration to detect your PR during phase validation**
>
> A partial-increment PR intentionally omits the closing keyword so the family/epic issue
> stays open — it still references the issue with `Part of #N` so the PR is discoverable.

### PR Label Rules

**When creating a NEW PR:**
- Add `loom:review-requested` label during creation
- This is the ONLY time you add labels to a PR

**After PR creation:**
- NEVER remove `loom:review-requested` (Judge does this)
- NEVER remove `loom:pr` (Judge adds this, Champion uses it)
- NEVER add `loom:pr` yourself (only Judge can approve)
- NEVER modify any labels on PRs you didn't create

**Why?** PR labels are signals in the review pipeline:
```
Builder creates PR -> loom:review-requested -> Judge reviews
                                            |
                      Judge removes loom:review-requested
                                            |
                      Judge adds loom:pr -> Champion merges
```

If you touch these labels, you break the pipeline.

### GitHub Auto-Close Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: When creating PRs, you MUST use GitHub's magic keywords to ensure issues auto-close when PRs merge.

### The Problem

If you write "Issue #123" or "Fixes issue #123", GitHub will NOT auto-close the issue. This leads to:
- Orphaned open issues that appear incomplete
- Manual cleanup work for maintainers
- Confusion about what's actually done

### The Solution: Use Magic Keywords

**ALWAYS use one of these exact formats in your PR description:**

```markdown
Closes #123
Fixes #123
Resolves #123
```

### Examples

**WRONG - Issue stays open after merge:**
```markdown
## Summary
This PR implements the feature requested in issue #123.

## Changes
- Added new functionality
- Updated tests
```

**CORRECT - Issue auto-closes on merge:**
```markdown
## Summary
Implement new feature to improve user experience.

## Changes
- Added new functionality
- Updated tests

Closes #123
```

### Why This Matters

GitHub's auto-close feature only works with specific keywords **immediately followed** by the issue reference:
- `Closes #X`
- `Fixes #X`
- `Resolves #X`
- `Closing #X`
- `Fixed #X`
- `Resolved #X`

**Any other phrasing will NOT trigger auto-close.**

> **The keyword does NOT have to start a line — GitHub scans the ENTIRE body.**
> `close`/`closes`/`closed`/`fix`/`fixes`/`fixed`/`resolve`/`resolves`/`resolved` creates a
> real closing reference **wherever** it appears — mid-sentence, inside a numbered list, in a
> "follow-up" checklist. What breaks the link is a word between the keyword and the reference
> (`close issue #X`, `Fixes issue #X`), not its position in the body. This cuts both ways: it
> is why `Fixes issue #123` silently fails to close, and why a stray `then close #123` buried
> in prose silently *does* close — see "Partial increments" below (#4569).

### Partial increments (family/epic issues)

The auto-close guidance above assumes one issue → one PR → close. Some issues track a **family** of work (labeled `loom:epic` / `loom:epic-phase`, or whose body explicitly scopes a family such as "~346 conformance failures across N files") and are intentionally landed in slices. For a PR that implements only a subset — with tracked work remaining after it merges — use a **non-closing** reference instead:

```markdown
Part of #123
Contributes to #123
```

`Part of #N` references the issue (keeping the PR discoverable) but does NOT trigger auto-close, so the family/epic issue survives the merge. Only the **final increment** that completes the family uses `Closes #N`.

**Both the PR body and the commit message must carry the same reference.** This repo squash-merges, and GitHub harvests closing keywords from the squash commit message as well as the PR body — a stray `Closes #N` in the commit body will auto-close the family issue even when the PR body says `Part of #N`. When in doubt on a `loom:epic` issue, prefer `Part of #N`.

#### A stray closing keyword ANYWHERE in the body defeats `Part of #N` (#4569)

`Part of #N` / `Contributes to #N` is not a shield. GitHub does not weigh the two references
against each other — **one** closing keyword adjacent to `#N` anywhere in the body is enough
to close the issue on merge, no matter how explicitly the rest of the body says otherwise.

This is a real, observed failure, not a hypothetical. A partial-increment PR ended with the
deliberate trailer `Contributes to #2` and an operator-handoff section that read:

```markdown
## Operator follow-up (after merge)

3. Verify `npm view censusapi` resolves to `0.0.1`, then close #2.   ← closes #2 on merge!
```

GitHub honored that `close #2`. The issue was closed on squash-merge and had to be reopened
by hand. (For the record: the head branch was `feature/issue-2`, but branch naming was *not*
the cause — Loom's `feature/issue-N` convention does not create a Development-sidebar link.)

**Rules for a partial-increment PR body:**

- **Never** write a closing keyword immediately before the tracked issue's number. Write
  `then close the issue`, or `then close issue #2` (the intervening word breaks the link).
- The tracked issue number should appear exactly once with a keyword: the `Part of #N` /
  `Contributes to #N` reference. Scan the whole body — including checklists, test plans, and
  operator-handoff sections — before creating the PR:

  ```bash
  # Must print nothing for the tracked issue N:
  grep -inE '\b(close[sd]?|fix(e[sd])?|resolve[sd]?)[[:space:]]+#N\b' <<<"$PR_BODY"
  ```

- **The same rule applies to every commit message on the branch** (#4595). The squash message
  GitHub composes from your commits is parsed for closing keywords too, so a stray
  `close #N` in a commit body closes the issue even when the PR body is spotless. Scan them
  before pushing — and amend/reword (`git commit --amend`, `git rebase -i`) if one is there:

  ```bash
  # Must print nothing for the tracked issue N:
  git log --format=%B origin/main..HEAD \
    | grep -inE '\b(close[sd]?|fix(e[sd])?|resolve[sd]?)[[:space:]]+#N\b'
  ```

**Backstop (not a substitute for the above)**: `merge-pr.sh` detects this contradiction
before merging — in the PR body, in any commit message of the PR, and in GitHub's
`closingIssuesReferences` — and warns naming which source is at fault, then reopens the issue
immediately after the merge if GitHub closed it anyway. That leaves a close/reopen flicker
plus notification churn on the issue — fix the body or the commit message instead of relying
on it.

### PR Creation Checklist

When creating a PR, verify:

1. **PR title uses conventional commit format** - e.g., `fix: descriptive summary` (see "PR Titles" above)
2. **Acceptance criteria verified** - Each criterion from issue explicitly checked (see "Acceptance Criteria Verification" above)
3. PR description references the issue: `Closes #X` for a full implementation, or `Part of #X` for a declared partial increment (not "Issue #X" or "Addresses #X") — same reference in the commit message
4. Issue number is correct
5. PR has `loom:review-requested` label
6. All CI checks pass locally (the project's check command — `buildGate.command` in `.loom/config.json`, e.g. `pnpm check:ci`) — **including the formatter/linter on changed files** (see "Format and Lint Changed Files" above); a format-only failure is a guaranteed Judge rejection, not a warning
7. PR description includes verification table for each criterion
8. Tests added/updated as needed
9. Commits carry a `Signed-off-by:` trailer if required (`commit.signoff: true` in `.loom/config.json`, or a DCO/`sign-off` check — see "DCO sign-off")

### Creating the PR

```bash
# CORRECT way to create PR
# Title MUST use conventional commit format: "fix:", "feat:", "refactor:", etc.
gh pr create --title "fix: descriptive summary of the change" --label "loom:review-requested" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criterion | Status | Verification |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Criterion 1 from issue | ✅ | How you verified it |
| Criterion 2 from issue | ✅ | How you verified it |

## Test Plan
How you verified the changes work.

Closes #123

)"
```

**Remember**:
- Put "Closes #123" (or "Part of #123" for a partial increment) on its own line in the PR description, and use the same reference in the commit message
- Include the acceptance criteria verification table showing each criterion was checked

## Handling Pre-existing Lint/Build Failures

**IMPORTANT**: When the target codebase has pre-existing issues, don't let them block your focused work.

### The Problem

Target codebases may have pre-existing failures that are unrelated to your issue:
- Deprecated linter configurations
- CSS classes not defined in newer framework versions
- A11y warnings in unrelated files
- Type errors in untouched code

**These are NOT your responsibility to fix when implementing a specific feature.**

### Strategy: Focus on Your Changes

**Step 1: Identify what you changed**

```bash
# Get list of files you modified
git diff --name-only origin/main
```

**Step 2: Run scoped checks on your changes only**

```bash
# Lint only changed files (Biome)
git diff --name-only origin/main -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.js' '*.jsx' | xargs npx biome check

# Lint only changed files (ESLint)
git diff --name-only origin/main -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.js' '*.jsx' | xargs npx eslint

# Type-check affected files (TypeScript will check dependencies automatically)
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Step 3: If full checks fail on pre-existing issues**

1. **Document in PR description** what pre-existing issues exist
2. **Don't fix unrelated issues** - this expands scope
3. **Optionally create a follow-up issue** for the tech debt

### PR Documentation Template

When pre-existing issues exist, add this to your PR:

```markdown
## Pre-existing Issues (Not Addressed)

The following issues exist in the codebase but are outside the scope of this PR:

- [ ] `biome.json` uses deprecated v1 schema (needs migration to v2)
- [ ] `DashboardPage.tsx` has a11y warnings (unrelated to this feature)
- [ ] Tailwind 4 CSS class `border-border` not defined

These should be addressed in separate PRs to maintain focused scope.
```

### Decision Tree

```
Lint/Build fails
|
Is the failure in YOUR changed files?
|-- YES -> Fix it (your responsibility)
+-- NO -> Pre-existing issue
         |-- Document in PR description
         |-- Continue with your implementation
         +-- Optionally create follow-up issue
```

### Creating Follow-up Issues (Optional)

If you want to track pre-existing issues for future cleanup:

> **File issues with `./.loom/scripts/create-issue.sh`, never a bare `gh issue create` (#5047).**
> `gh issue create` fails outright when GraphQL quota is exhausted, while the independent REST
> pool sits ~99% unused. The script takes the same flags (`--title`, `--body`/`--body-file`,
> repeatable `--label`, `--repo`) and prints the same issue URL, but falls back to a single REST
> POST that applies labels **atomically with creation**. Recipe and rationale:
> `.loom/docs/gh-issue-create-rest-fallback.md` (or `forge_gh_create_issue_rl_safe` in
> `lib/forge-helpers.sh` if scripting). `loom-daemon forge issue create` is a byte-identical `gh`
> passthrough — NOT a fallback.

```bash
./.loom/scripts/create-issue.sh --title "Tech debt: Migrate biome.json to v2 schema" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem

`biome.json` uses deprecated v1 schema which causes warnings on every lint run.

## Discovery

Found while working on #969. Not fixed there to maintain focused scope.

## Solution

Run `npx @biomejs/biome migrate` to update configuration.

## Impact

- Removes deprecation warnings
- Enables new linter rules
- Estimated: 30 minutes

```

### What NOT to Do

**Don't block your PR on unrelated failures**
```bash
# WRONG: Spending hours fixing biome config for an unrelated feature
```

**Don't include unrelated fixes in your PR**
```bash
# WRONG: PR titled "Add login button" that also migrates linter config
```

**Don't ignore failures in YOUR code**
```bash
# WRONG: Introducing new lint errors in the code you wrote
```

### Why This Matters

**Scope creep kills productivity:**
- Issue #921 spent 2+ hours on biome migration (unrelated to feature)
- Issue #922 fixed a11y warnings in files not touched by the feature
- Each detour adds risk and delays the actual goal

**Focused PRs are better:**
- Easier to review (one concern per PR)
- Faster to merge (no surprises)
- Clearer git history (each commit has one purpose)
- Lower risk (smaller blast radius)

## Raising Concerns

After completing your assigned work, you can suggest improvements by creating unlabeled issues. The Architect will triage them and the user decides priority.

**Example of post-work suggestion:**
```bash
./.loom/scripts/create-issue.sh --title "Refactor terminal state management to use reducer pattern" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Problem

While implementing #42, I noticed that terminal state updates are scattered across multiple files with inconsistent patterns.

## Current Code

- State mutations in: `src/lib/state.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/lib/terminal-manager.ts`
- No single source of truth for state transitions
- Hard to debug state-related issues

## Proposed Refactor

- Single `terminalReducer` function handling all state transitions
- Action types for each state change
- Easier to test and debug

## Impact

- **Files**: ~5 files affected
- **Complexity**: Medium (2-3 days)
- **Risk**: Low if we add comprehensive tests first
