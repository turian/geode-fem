# guard-destructive.sh - PreToolUse hook to block destructive agent commands
#
# Part of Repo Skills (https://github.com/rjwalters/repo), and the CANONICAL
# generic destructive-command guard (rjwalters/repo#30): Loom and other tooling
# defer to this copy rather than shipping their own. It is installed by
# install.sh into .claude/skills/repo/hooks/ and wired into the consumer repo's
# .claude/settings.json PreToolUse -> Bash matcher.
#
# Provenance: the precision work in this file (segment parsing, quote-aware
# splitting, literal-text redaction, the read-only fast path, toggles, decision
# telemetry) was developed in rjwalters/loom and consolidated here. Bare issue
# refs like (#3553)/(#3771) refer to rjwalters/loom issues; refs written
# repo#NN refer to rjwalters/repo.
#
# =============================================================================
# STABLE INTERFACE (the contract downstream tools — e.g. Loom — rely on)
# =============================================================================
#
# Input:  JSON on stdin with .tool_input.command and .cwd (Claude Code
#         PreToolUse hook payload). An empty/absent command allows.
# Output: silence + exit 0  => allow;  otherwise a single JSON object:
#   { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
#       "permissionDecision": "deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason": "..." } }
# Exit:   ALWAYS 0, even on deny/ask/internal error. The "hookEventName" field
#         is REQUIRED by Claude Code's schema — without it the decision is
#         silently discarded and the guard becomes inert.
# Errors: this script MUST never exit non-zero or emit invalid output. Any
#         internal error is caught by the ERR trap, logged to
#         <script-dir>/../logs/hook-errors.log, and resolves to allow (fail
#         open) to prevent infinite retry loops in Claude Code.
#
# Config: guards.* keys are read from BOTH config locations —
#           .claude/skills/repo/config.json   (Repo Skills' own; WINS)
#           .loom/config.json                 (legacy/Loom; fallback)
#         Env vars override config; the REPO_* name wins over the legacy
#         LOOM_* name. Both names are a stable part of this interface.

#
# It does NOT fire with:
#   --permission-mode bypassPermissions  <- hooks SKIPPED entirely
#
# If you have a shell alias like 'alias claude="claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions"',
# this safety hook will be silently disabled in interactive sessions.
# Use --dangerously-skip-permissions instead for automation that needs hooks.
#

#   - Block (deny): Dangerous commands that should never run
#   - Ask: Commands that need human confirmation
#   - Allow: Everything else (exit 0, no output)

# DECISION TELEMETRY (issue #3771) — one JSONL record per deny/ask decision.
#
# Append a machine-readable record to DECISION_LOG each time the guard denies or
# asks, so false-positive friction becomes measurable (which patterns fire, how
# often, before/after a precision fix). Deliberately does NOT log `allow`: the
# #3687 read-only fast path's zero-overhead silent-allow must stay silent, and
# allow-logging would swamp the log with the ~99% common case.
#
# STABLE SCHEMA (the contract #3772's reader/aggregation tooling stacks on — do
# NOT rename fields without considering that dependency), one JSON object per
# line:
#   {"ts":"<UTC>","decision":"deny"|"ask","pattern":"<tag>",
#    "tier":"catastrophic"|"ask","command":"<redacted>"}
#     ts       — UTC timestamp, same format as log_hook_error's date -u call.
#     decision — "deny" or "ask".
#     pattern  — a short, stable rule tag (NOT the full free-text reason). For
#                the pattern-array loops it is the matched pattern; the non-loop
#                sites pass a static tag (e.g. "sql-ddl", "rm-protected-path").
#     tier     — "catastrophic" for deny, "ask" for ask.
#     command  — the command string, REDACTED via strip_literal_text() so no raw
#                --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment secret value is persisted.
#
# Best-effort like log_hook_error: gated by the lazy decision_log_enabled()
# toggle, and a log-write failure (permission denied, disk full, missing dir)
# NEVER changes the deny/ask decision and NEVER causes a non-zero exit. Callers
# invoke it as `log_guard_decision ... || true` so it can never trip the ERR
# trap.
#

# =============================================================================
# READ-ONLY FAST PATH (issue #3687) — default ON.
#
# guard-destructive.sh is a PreToolUse/Bash hook, so it fires before EVERY Bash
# tool call. In Bash-dense sessions (remote ops, benchmark drivers) the vast
# majority of those calls are obviously read-only — `git status`, `ls`, `grep`,
# `aws … describe*`, `gh … list` — yet each one still runs the full deny/ask
# gauntlet (~37 grep/awk/sed forks + a git rev-parse, ~179ms measured). This
# block short-circuits that overwhelmingly-common case to a silent `allow` with
# a single bash-builtin structural test (zero forks) plus, only when that test
# passes, one lazy `jq` config read.
#
# SECURITY: a fast path is a guard bypass by construction, so admission is
# purely STRUCTURAL and conservative — never content-sensitive:
#   1. Reject fast-path eligibility if the raw command contains ANY of
#      ;  &  |  <  >  backtick  $(  or a newline. This kills chaining, piping,
#      redirection, and command substitution (so `git status && <force-push>`,
#      `git status; rm -rf /`, `git status $(rm -rf /)`, `git status > /etc/x`
#      all fall through to the full path unchanged).
#   2. Exact first-token (command-word) allowlist — never a wrapper. Because the
#      allowlist is keyed on the literal first token, wrapper forms (`bash -c`,
#      `sh -c`, `eval`, `xargs`, `env … git status`, `sudo git status`) are
#      excluded automatically: their first token isn't allowlisted.
#   3. Verb/subcommand exactness for multi-word tools, chosen to be provably
#      disjoint from every existing deny/ask pattern:
#        git status|log|diff|show  (bare — `git -C /p status` is NOT admitted)
#        ls  grep  rg
#        jq  wc  head  tail        (pure read-only text/JSON filters — none has
#          an in-place-mutation flag, so any args are admitted, #3772)
#        test  [  [[               (boolean file/string test builtins — no
#          mutation surface at all, #3772)
#        find                      (admitted for any args EXCEPT when a dangerous
#          action-primary is present: -delete, -exec, -execdir, -ok, -okdir,
#          -fls, -fprint, -fprint0, -fprintf. Any of those disqualifies eligibility
#          and falls through to the full path — structural, not content-scanned,
#          so a future `find -delete` deny rule is never silently bypassed, #3772)
#        gh <noun> view|list       (never delete/close/archive/…)
#        aws <service> describe*|get*|list*  and  aws s3 ls   (mirrors the
#          verb-anchoring already in CLOUD_ASK_PATTERNS: those verbs are never
#          mutating, so this only skips greps that were going to allow anyway)
#   cat and ssh are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from the built-in list:
#     - cat has a narrow existing ASK carve-out (cat …/.ssh/, cat …/.aws/
#       credentials); a blanket cat fast-path would silently skip it.
#     - ssh wraps an OPAQUE remote command string that the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK scan
#       still covers today; fast-pathing any `ssh …` would drop that coverage.
#
# False NEGATIVES (declining eligibility) are always safe — they just fall
# through to the correct, slower existing behavior. False POSITIVES are the only
# danger, so the eligibility test stays maximally conservative.
#
# CONFIG-ORDERING CHOICE: this block runs BEFORE REPO_ROOT is resolved (the git
# rev-parse subprocess below), on purpose — the structural test never needs the
# repo root. Only the toggle/extra-list config read needs a config file, and it
# is resolved LAZILY (only after structural admission already passed) by walking
# up from CWD to the nearest guard config (.claude/skills/repo/config.json or
# legacy .loom/config.json) WITHOUT forking git
# (fastpath_config_file). So a fast-pathed command pays: 1 bash-builtin test +
# (only if eligible) 1 stat-walk + 1 jq read — never the git rev-parse, never a
# deny/ask array, never a log write.
#
# Toggle: guards.readOnlyFastPath (default true) / LOOM_GUARD_READONLY_FASTPATH
# env (0/false/no disables, 1/true/yes forces on; env wins). Optional
# guards.readOnlyFastPathExtra is an EXTEND-ONLY array of literal first-word
# commands (each entry is a full-generality bypass for that command word).

# QUOTE-AWARE COMMAND SEGMENTATION (#3755)
#
# The three segment parsers below (parse_force_ops, lifecycle_or_cloud_reason,
# extract_rm_targets) split a command string on the shell separators ; | & && ||
# to find each simple command's command word. The historical split was a naive
#   gsub(/&&|\|\||[;|&]/, "\n")
# over the raw string, which has NO lexer — so a `|`-alternation INSIDE a quoted
# argument (e.g. `grep -E "lifecycle|halt|poweroff"`) was split as if it were a
# real pipe, manufacturing a phantom segment whose command word is the bare word
# `halt` and hard-denying a completely read-only command.
#
# `qsplit()` replaces that gsub: it walks the string tracking single-/double-quote
# state and emits a newline for a separator ONLY when it is OUTSIDE a quoted span.
# A quoted span is treated as inert (its separators are preserved as literal
# text) ONLY when it carries no command substitution — no `$(` and no backtick —
# mirroring strip_literal_text()'s #3679 safety floor: a smuggled
# `"$(a|halt)"` keeps its separators ACTIVE so the genuine protection is intact.
# The token VALUES are preserved verbatim (unlike a redaction approach), so
# extract_rm_targets still sees the real `rm` targets. Best-effort like
# strip_literal_text(): backslash-escaped quotes and an unterminated quote fall
# back to the old separator-active behaviour, never widening a deny into an allow.
#
# Shared as a single awk source string so the three parsers cannot drift.

# Parse force-op segments out of a command, emitting one TAB-separated

# only (mirrors extract_rm_targets / lifecycle_or_cloud_reason segment parsing):
#   - split on ; | & && || and newline, strip a leading sudo wrapper.
#   - only a segment whose command word is `git` is considered.
#   - `git -C <path> ...` sets <cpath>; other pre-subcommand global options are
#     skipped (`-c <k=v>` consumes its argument).
#   - push: emitted only when a --force/-f/--force-with-lease flag is present.
#     ONE line is emitted per positional refspec (pos[2], pos[3], …) after the
#     remote — a multi-refspec push like `git push --force origin a b` emits a
#     line for `a` AND `b`, so a protected branch in any refspec position (not
#     just the first) reaches the caller's per-line check (#3674 follow-up).

# Redact the quoted VALUES of known text-carrying flags (--body, -m/--message,
# --title, --notes, --comment) so a dangerous-looking phrase quoted INSIDE such a
# value no longer trips the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS substring scan (catastrophic
# tier) or the ASK_PATTERNS scan (ask tier, #3756). Used ONLY to build the
# literal-redacted working copies for those two loops (mirrors the
# COMMAND_NO_COMMENT precedent); every other scan keeps reading the raw command.
# This kills the #3679 false positive where `gh pr comment --body "…git push
# --force origin main…"` / `git commit -m "…"` hard-denied even though nothing
# executes, and (#3756) the analogous ask-tier false ask where an ask-phrase like
# `gh issue close` quoted inside a `--comment`/`--body` value prompted for
# confirmation despite no such command actually being run.
#
# Safety floor preserved two ways:
#   - `-c` is deliberately NOT a text-carrying flag, so `bash -c '<payload>'`
#     is never redacted and its payload stays caught by the raw scan.
#   - a quoted span is redacted ONLY when it carries no command-substitution or
#     backtick opener (`$(` — which also subsumes the arithmetic `$((` — or a
#     backtick). So a smuggling attempt like `git commit -m "$(git push --force
#     origin main)"` is left intact and still hard-denies.
# Each redacted span is replaced by a SAME-LENGTH placeholder so byte offsets of
# the surrounding command are unchanged. Best-effort like COMMAND_NO_COMMENT:
# it does not model backslash-escaped quotes, but since the result feeds only
# the narrowing (never widening) catastrophic scan, the worst case is a raw

#
# The system-lifecycle commands (halt/reboot/poweroff/shutdown/init 0/init 6)
# and the az/gcloud cloud-delete CLIs are far too common as ordinary prose,
# identifiers, and flag names to scan as unanchored substrings — and even a
# whitespace-inclusive boundary anchor still fired inside comments and commit
# messages ("...the box will halt", "...after a reboot event"). A pure regex
# tweak cannot separate `sudo halt` (a real command) from `will halt` (prose)
# because both are "<word> halt".
#
# So we segment-parse instead, mirroring extract_rm_targets(): split the command
# on ; | & && || and newline, strip a leading sudo/env wrapper from each segment,
# and deny only when a segment's *command word* (first token) is exactly a
# lifecycle word — or is `az`/`gcloud` with a `delete` subcommand token. This
# distinguishes `sudo halt` (command word = halt) from `will halt` (command word
# = echo/other) and from `--instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior` (not a command
# word at all). The scan runs against COMMAND_NO_COMMENT so a lifecycle/cloud
# word sitting in a trailing comment is already gone. The catastrophic
# ALWAYS_BLOCK scan above still reads the raw string for the symbolic patterns
# (rm -rf /, the fork bomb, curl|sh) that are not prose-prone (#3584).

# Only *actual local* `rm` command words are inspected. `extract_rm_targets`
# splits the command on ; | & && || and, for each simple-command segment whose
# command word is `rm` (optionally sudo-prefixed) AND which carries a
# recursive/force flag, emits the non-flag argument tokens. Consequences (#3553):
#   - A token from an earlier command in the same line (e.g. the `host-ip.txt`
#     in `HOST=$(cat host-ip.txt); ssh $HOST rm -rf …`) is never mis-read as an
#     rm target — only tokens of a real `rm` segment are considered.
#   - An `rm` inside a remote payload (`ssh host 'rm -rf /home/ubuntu/foo'`) is
#     NOT treated as a local rm: the wrapper's command word is `ssh`/`scp`, not
#     `rm`, so no local target is emitted and the local scope check is skipped.
#     The ALWAYS_BLOCK catastrophic patterns above still scan the whole string,
#     so a remote or quoted `rm -rf /` still denies.
#   - Only root, the user's $HOME, and *top-level* directories (/tmp, /var, /etc,
#     /usr, /home, /opt, /bin, …) are blocked. A scoped subpath such as
#     `rm -rf /tmp/whatever` or `rm -rf /var/foo` is allowed — the guard stops

# git read-tree WITHOUT an isolating GIT_INDEX_FILE assignment
#
# A bare `git read-tree` (no tree-ish, no isolated index) is equivalent to
# `git read-tree --empty`: it clobbers the repository's REAL staging index,
# turning every tracked file into a phantom staged deletion. The working tree
# and HEAD are left untouched and NO reflog entry is written, so the corruption
# is silent and near-invisible (issue #3637 — a judge ran one against the main
# checkout during a merge simulation and emptied the live index).
#
# This is an ASK (not a deny) because it is generic git hygiene, not a Loom
# workflow rule, and an isolated form is legitimate. It is kept narrow: the
# safe, index-free path is `git merge-tree --write-tree <base> <branch>` for a
# merge preview, or `GIT_INDEX_FILE=$(mktemp) git read-tree <tree>` when a
# temporary index really is needed. Any command that carries a `GIT_INDEX_FILE=`
# assignment is treated as isolated and passes through untouched.

# `git commit-tree` is intentionally NOT guarded here — it writes a commit
# object from an existing tree and does not mutate the index.
