#!/usr/bin/env bash
# session-start-handoff.sh - SessionStart hook that surfaces a pending
# /repo:handoff note at the start of a Claude Code session.
#
# Part of Repo Skills (https://github.com/rjwalters/repo), installed by
# install.sh into .claude/skills/repo/hooks/ and wired into the consumer repo's
# .claude/settings.json under hooks.SessionStart (matchers "startup" and
# "resume").
#
# WHY: /repo:handoff writes .claude/handoff.md and adds a pointer line to the
# agent's memory index. That makes the note findable, but nothing announces it,
# and the command's one-shot contract ("read it, then delete it") means a note
# that never gets absorbed lingers silently. handoff.md calls a stale note "a
# trap of its own". This hook makes both facts visible at session start.
#
# =============================================================================
# STABLE INTERFACE (the contract install.sh/uninstall.sh and the tests rely on)
# =============================================================================
#
# Input:  JSON on stdin (Claude Code SessionStart payload). Fields consumed:
#           .cwd    - the session's working directory
#           .source - "startup" | "resume" | "clear" | "compact" | "fork"
#         Anything else in the payload is ignored.
#
# Output: silence + exit 0  => nothing to surface;  otherwise EXACTLY one JSON
#         object on stdout:
#           { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
#               "additionalContext": "..." } }
#         The "hookEventName" field is REQUIRED by Claude Code's schema -
#         without it the additionalContext is silently discarded.
#
# Exit:   ALWAYS 0, on every path including internal error. SessionStart has no
#         decision control (a hook cannot block session start), so the only
#         thing a failure here can accomplish is noise in the transcript.
#
# Errors: this script MUST never exit non-zero and never emit invalid output.
#         Any internal error is caught by the ERR trap, logged to
#         <script-dir>/../logs/hook-errors.log, and resolves to silence (fail
#         open) - mirroring guard-destructive.sh's convention.
#
# READ-ONLY: this hook never writes, deletes, or modifies .claude/handoff.md or
#         any other file in the repo. Deleting the note after it is absorbed is
#         the /repo:handoff one-shot contract's job, not this hook's. The only
#         file it may ever write is its own diagnostic error log.
#
# SOURCE GATING: only "startup" and "resume" are acted on. install.sh wires
#         exactly those two matchers, and this script re-checks .source anyway
#         so a hand-edited settings.json that routes "clear"/"compact"/"fork"
#         here still no-ops. A /clear is not a process relaunch and the note has
#         not been touched, so repeating the banner there is pure noise.
