# Repo Skills

General-purpose tools for keeping a git repository healthy and productive. The
hygiene commands **apply their safe, reversible fixes by default** and report
each change; add `--ask` to review findings and confirm first. Anything
irreversible — deleting a branch, worktree, stash, or untracked file — is never
automatic: it takes an explicit opt-in and passes a permanent-loss check.
Commands whose only action is consequential (`orphans`, `update-tools`,
`followups`, `release`, `remote`) always confirm first by nature. The environment commands (`remote`) stand up
infrastructure only after showing exactly what they will create and what it
costs.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [[help]] | Explain the installed `/repo:*` commands — what each does, where to start |
| [[all]] | The whole hygiene pass in order — audit, docs, tidy, update-tools, reset — safe fixes by default, destructive steps gated |
| [[audit]] | Full sweep — runs all hygiene checks, produces a summary report |
| [[reset]] | Back to baseline — review stale worktrees/branches/stashes, sync with remote, return to the default branch |
| [[handoff]] | Roll the session safely — file follow-ups, reset, check for a CLI update, write a handoff note the next session reads first |
| [[tidy]] | Tidy up — build artifacts, caches, temp files, empty dirs |
| [[release]] | Cut a release — pre-flight, semver decision, CHANGELOG, version bump, tag, GitHub Release |
| [[remote]] | Launch a cloud dev session (GCP or AWS) with this repo ready to go, then open SSH |
| [[update-tools]] | Check installed tool packages (Loom, Anvil, …) against their sources and offer updates |
| [[followups]] | Capture follow-on work from this session and file it as issues — here or in upstream tool repos, always confirmed first |
| [[branches]] | Branch & worktree hygiene — merged PRs, orphaned branches, stale worktrees |
| [[gitignore]] | Gitignore hygiene — over-ignored files, under-ignored build artifacts |
| [[docs]] | Documentation health — content accuracy, README structure, cross-references (canonical docs command) |
| [[links]] | Internal cross-references — markdown links, CLAUDE.md paths, skill graph |
| [[orphans]] | Files with no references — dead scripts, stale data, outputs without sources |
| [[readme]] | README accuracy vs actual directory contents |

## When to Use

- After finishing a task, to get back to a known-good state (`reset`)
- After a large refactor, consolidation, or import (`audit`, `docs`)
- When the working tree feels messy (`tidy`, `orphans`)
- When `git branch` output has grown unmanageable (`branches`)
- When local hardware isn't enough or you need a clean Linux box (`remote`)
- Periodically, to keep installed tool packages current (`update-tools`)
- Periodically (monthly) as general hygiene (`audit`)
- Before a demo, handoff, or onboarding (clean up before they arrive)

## Principles

1. **Apply safe fixes, gate destructive ones.** Reversible fixes (doc/link/
   gitignore edits, regenerable clutter) apply by default and are reported as
   they're made; `--ask` restores review-and-confirm. Irreversible actions
   — deleting branches, worktrees, stashes, untracked files, or creating
   infrastructure — are never automatic: show the plan (and cost, for cloud
   resources), run the permanent-loss check, and act only on explicit opt-in.
2. **Scope matters.** Most hygiene commands accept an optional path argument to
   limit scope (e.g., `/repo:readme docs/`). Without it, they scan the full repo.
3. **General by design.** These commands make no assumptions about org,
   project structure, or infrastructure. Anything repo-specific is read from
   the consumer repo's own files (CLAUDE.md conventions, `.env`),
   never hardcoded.
4. **Don't be noisy.** Only flag things that are actually wrong or confusing.
   A missing README in a tiny utility directory isn't worth flagging.

## Destructive-command guard (PreToolUse hook)

Installing Repo Skills also wires a **PreToolUse safety hook** —
`.claude/skills/repo/hooks/guard-destructive.sh` — into the consumer repo's
`.claude/settings.json`. This is the **canonical generic destructive-command
guard** (rjwalters/repo#30): Loom and other tooling defer to this copy instead
of shipping their own. It runs before every agent `Bash` command and:

- **Blocks** catastrophic operations outright: `rm -rf` of root / `$HOME` / a
  top-level system dir (with lexical `..`/`//` normalization so traversal
  can't smuggle one past), `rm` targets outside the repo/temp scope (see
  `rmScope` below), force-push to `main`/`master`, fork bombs, piping a
  download to a shell (`curl … | sh` — only when the pipe target *is* a
  shell), `gh repo delete`/`archive`, `docker system prune`, cloud destruction
  (`aws iam delete`, `aws s3 rb`, `aws cloudformation delete-stack`,
  `az … delete`, `gcloud … delete`), system-lifecycle commands
  (`halt`/`reboot`/`poweroff`/`shutdown`/`init 0|6`, command-word matched so
  prose never trips), and SQL DDL/DML (`DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`,
  `DELETE FROM …` without a `WHERE`).
- **Asks** for confirmation on risky-but-legitimate ones: force ops
  (`git push --force` / `git reset --hard`, branch-aware via `forceScope`),
  `git clean -fd`, un-isolated `git read-tree`, mutating cloud verbs
  (`aws ec2 run|terminate|stop-…`, `aws s3 cp|rm|sync`, `docker rm|stop|…` —
  read-only `describe*`/`ls`/`get*` never prompt), `kubectl delete`,
  `gh release delete`, credential reads (`cat ~/.ssh/…`), etc.
- **Allows** everything else — scoped deletes like `rm -rf node_modules` or
  `/tmp` subpaths, and obviously read-only commands (`git status`, `ls`,
  `grep`, …) via a structural fast path that skips the pattern gauntlet.

Precision features ported from Loom's guard: quote-aware command segmentation
(a `|` inside quotes is not a pipe), literal-text redaction (a dangerous phrase
quoted in `--body`/`-m`/`--title`/`--notes`/`--comment` values doesn't trip the
scan — command substitution inside such a value still does), comment stripping,
and an opt-in JSONL decision-telemetry log for measuring guard friction.

The hook only fires when Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
(it is skipped entirely under `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`).

### Configuring per repo

All toggles resolve: `REPO_*` env var (wins) → legacy `LOOM_*` env var →
`guards.<key>` in `.claude/skills/repo/config.json` (wins) → legacy
`.loom/config.json` → default. On/off values: `0`/`false`/`no` and
`1`/`true`/`yes`.

| Toggle | Env var (wins) | Legacy env var | Config key | Default |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Read-only fast path | `REPO_GUARD_READONLY_FASTPATH` | `LOOM_GUARD_READONLY_FASTPATH` | `guards.readOnlyFastPath` (+ extend-only `guards.readOnlyFastPathExtra`) | on |
| SQL DDL/DML | `REPO_GUARD_SQL` | `LOOM_GUARD_SQL` | `guards.sqlDdl` | on |
| Cloud CLI (mutating-verb asks + `az`/`gcloud` delete denies) | `REPO_GUARD_CLOUD` | `LOOM_GUARD_CLOUD` | `guards.cloudCli` | on |
| Reversible-GitHub asks (`gh pr/issue close`, `gh label delete`) | `REPO_GUARD_REVERSIBLE_GH` | `LOOM_GUARD_REVERSIBLE_GH` | `guards.reversibleGh` | **off** (opt-in) |
| rm scope (`repo` denies outside-repo/temp targets; `off`/`permissive` restores legacy) | `REPO_RM_SCOPE` | `LOOM_RM_SCOPE` | `guards.rmScope` | `repo` |
| Force-op branch scope (`all` / `protected` / `off`) | `REPO_FORCE_SCOPE` | `LOOM_FORCE_SCOPE` | `guards.forceScope` | `all` |
| Decision telemetry log | `REPO_GUARD_DECISION_LOG` (path: `REPO_GUARD_DECISION_LOG_FILE`) | `LOOM_GUARD_DECISION_LOG` (`…_FILE`) | `guards.decisionLog` | **off** (opt-in) |

For the on-by-default guards only an explicit `false` disables — a missing key
or malformed config keeps the guard on; the opt-in toggles are the inverse.

```json
// .claude/skills/repo/config.json
{ "guards": { "sqlDdl": false, "cloudCli": true, "forceScope": "protected" } }
```

The full stable interface (input/output contract, exit semantics, every env
name) is documented in the hook's own header — downstream tools (e.g. Loom's
installer) gate on it via this repo's release version.

## Handoff-note hook (SessionStart)

The installer wires a second hook, `session-start-handoff.sh`, as two
`SessionStart` entries — one matching `startup`, one matching `resume`. When
[[handoff]] has left a note at `.claude/handoff.md`, the hook emits it as
session context via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`: the note's path,
its age, an outline built from its `#`/`##` headers, and a staleness warning
once the note passes seven days. It renders headers only, never the full body —
a real handoff note runs to several KB, far too much to inject on every launch.

Behavioral contract:

- **Read-only.** It never writes, deletes, or modifies the note. Absorbing the
  note and deleting it is [[handoff]]'s own one-shot contract.
- **Silent when there is nothing to say.** No note, or an unreadable one, means
  no output and exit 0.
- **Fails open.** Malformed stdin, a missing `cwd`, or any internal error exits
  0 with no output. A hook fault must never block session start.
- **Skips `/clear`.** `clear` is not a process relaunch, so re-emitting the
  banner there would be noise.

There are no configuration toggles — the hook's behavior is fixed. To disable
it, remove its `SessionStart` entries from `.claude/settings.json` (or run
`uninstall.sh`, which removes only the entries it owns).
