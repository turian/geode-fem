# /repo:handoff — Roll the Session Safely

Rolling a Claude Code session — quitting the CLI and starting fresh — is the
moment a session's most valuable output is most likely to be lost, because what
is worth carrying forward is exactly what exists *only* in the session's
context: in-flight state, settled decisions, and empirically-discovered traps.
This command makes the roll a repeatable ritual instead of an ad-hoc scramble.

It **composes** the existing commands rather than reimplementing them —
[[followups]] to capture deferred work, [[reset]] to reach a clean git baseline
— and adds only what does not exist yet: the CLI version check, the handoff
note, and exact restart instructions.

**Relationship to `/compact`:** compaction handles the *soft* boundary —
context pressure within a continuous session. `/repo:handoff` handles the
*hard* boundary: process restart, CLI upgrade, or a deliberate fresh start. If
the version check below finds no update and the only pressure is context size,
say so — a `/compact` may be all that's needed.

## Usage

```
/repo:handoff                  # Run the ritual end-to-end, confirmations as usual
/repo:handoff --dry-run        # Preview the note and proposed actions; file, prune, and write nothing
/repo:handoff --prune          # Pass --prune through to the reset stage
```

## Steps — ordering is load-bearing

Run the stages in exactly this order. Each later stage depends on the earlier
ones having actually happened.

### 1. File follow-ups first (see [[followups]])

Run the full [[followups]] flow — mine the session, propose, confirm, file.
This must precede reset because [[reset]] prunes branches, worktrees, and
stashes that a follow-up may need to reference, and filing wants the git state
reset is about to remove. Record the issue URLs actually filed (and anything
proposed-but-declined) — the note needs them.

Under `--dry-run`, run followups in its own `--dry-run` mode: propose, file
nothing.

### 2. Reset to baseline (see [[reset]])

Run the full [[reset]] ritual: working-tree safety check, stash review, branch
& worktree review, remote sync, land on the default branch. Pass `--prune`
through if given. All of reset's gates apply unchanged — nothing irreversible
happens without explicit approval, and a dirty working tree stops the ritual
until the user decides (commit / stash / abort). Record what reset actually
did and what it intentionally left behind.

Under `--dry-run`, report what reset *would* do without acting.

### 3. Check the CLI version — before recommending a restart

Best-effort, never blocking:

```bash
claude --version                 # what this session is running
npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code version 2>/dev/null   # latest, if npm is available
```

Report one of: **update available** (restart is worth it — note both versions),
**current** (a restart gains nothing; if the motive was context pressure,
suggest `/compact` instead), or **unknown** (say so plainly — do not guess).

### 4. Write the handoff note last

Written last because it must record what followups actually filed and what
reset actually did — any earlier and it is speculative.

**Where it lives (both halves required):**

1. `.claude/handoff.md` in this repo — repo-scoped and discoverable. Ensure it
   is gitignored (add a `.claude/handoff.md` entry if not already covered);
   the note is session state, never a commit.
2. A pointer in the agent's auto-memory index (`MEMORY.md` in the memory
   directory, when one exists): a single line —
   `- Handoff note at .claude/handoff.md — READ FIRST, then delete note + this line.`
   The memory index is read automatically at session start; the pointer is
   what makes the repo file reliably found rather than merely present.

**What goes in — only what is not recoverable from the repo:**

- **In-flight state** — open PRs and what they await, running background work,
  anything mid-flight.
- **Decisions and their rationale** — settled questions the next session must
  not relitigate.
- **Empirically-discovered traps** — "this command hangs", "this flag silently
  no-ops": findings that cost real time and are invisible in the code.
- **The precise next action** — one concrete step, not a roadmap.

Deliberately **exclude** anything readable from git history, the issue
tracker, or `CLAUDE.md` — the exclusion discipline is what keeps the note
short enough to be read.

**Honesty constraint:** every item carries a verification status —
`[verified]` (done and checked), `[believed-done]` (done, not re-checked), or
`[attempted]` (tried, outcome uncertain). A handoff that overstates completion
is worse than none, because the next session builds on it.

**One-shot contract:** the note describes a single moment. The next session
reads it, absorbs it, then deletes both the note and the memory pointer —
promoting anything durable into real memory files or issues. A stale handoff
lying around is a trap of its own.

Under `--dry-run`, print the note to the conversation instead of writing it.

### 5. Emit the restart block — and stop

The agent cannot quit, upgrade, or relaunch its own process. Do not pretend
to. End by printing an exact, copy-pasteable block for the human, e.g.:

```
# In this terminal:
#   1. Quit this session (Ctrl+C or /exit)
#   2. If an update was available:
claude update
#   3. Relaunch in this repo:
cd <repo-root> && claude
# The new session will find the handoff note via its memory index.
```

Then stop. The ritual is complete when the note is durable and the
instructions are on screen — the restart itself belongs to the human.

## Principles

Same as every hygiene command: **apply safe fixes, gate destructive ones** —
this command adds no gates of its own but inherits every gate of the commands
it composes ([[followups]] always confirms before filing; [[reset]] never
destroys without opt-in). **Don't be noisy**: the note's value comes from what
it excludes.
