## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-29

This release repositions GEODE-FEM as a differentiable-by-construction
complement to Palace: the full 2×2 sensitivity matrix (material + geometry ×
scalar + H(curl) EM) is FD-validated and mutation-tested, and it is exercised
end-to-end by a driven-Maxwell shape-adjoint chain that culminates in
many-DOF freeform inverse design of a curved conformal radiator. Alongside
the adjoint work, a matrix-free eigensolve path with a full Hiptmair–Xu AMS
preconditioner opens the road past the direct-LU memory wall, and a suite of
validated benchmarks lands: slotless-PM Arkkio torque T(θ) at 0.71 %, SMF-28
LP01 modal b at 0.88 %, and transmon capacitance/EPR extraction. The
workspace itself goes standalone (vendored Palace docker, external refs
scrubbed) and gains the `geode-app` harness, standalone example crates, and
the `geode-util` pre-core staging crate.

### Added

#### Differentiable sensitivities — the full 2×2 matrix (Epic #569)

- Discrete-adjoint material sensitivity ∂(observable)/∂ε on the scalar path
  (#570, #573) and geometry/shape gradient ∂(observable)/∂X (#571, #575),
  both FD-validated.

  ∂(EM observable)/∂(node coords) (#581), completing the matrix; complex-ε
  (loss-tangent) sensitivities on the driven adjoint (#598).
- Hellmann–Feynman eigenvalue sensitivities ∂λ/∂p (#600) and
  inductance-matrix reluctivity sensitivity ∂L/∂ν via the self-adjoint
  energy form (#615).

#### Driven shape-adjoint chain → freeform inverse design

- |S11|² shape-adjoint objective closure and the first driven-Maxwell
  optimization loop (#627); complex-ε lossy shape adjoint (#630);
  pinned-feed (#632) and moving-feed (#644) lumped-port terminations in the
  shape adjoint; box-UPML tensor-material adjoint at fixed Λ (#643).
- Composed open-radiator shape adjoint + full inverse-design capstone
  (#645); high-DOF freeform boundary parametrization with mesh-morph
  regularizer (#654); curved conformal radiator fixture (#653) and many-DOF

- Full Hiptmair–Xu AMS cycle: three-space AMS as the SPD preconditioner for
  indefinite MINRES (#560), the vector-nodal ΠᵀAΠ block (#553), an
  O(node_dim) few-sweep coarse solve (#554) with a smoothed-aggregation AMG
  alternative (#566), and the `transmon_bench` scale harness (#552).
- Distributed groundwork: geometric k-way edge-DOF partitioner + halo map
  (#642) and a distributed matrix-free Krylov abstraction with a
  single-process mock collective (#646).
- Opt-in `InnerSolver::DirectCustomOrder` — custom fill-reducing LU ordering
  via faer's public deeper API (#543, #544).

#### Second-order elements

- 20-DOF second-order Nédélec tet element (#617) with an opt-in p=2 driven
  forward path + material adjoint (#621), p=2 PEC-cube eigensolve with a
  frequency-convergence gate (#622), and a p=2 shape adjoint via a dual
  element twin (#623).
- P2 Lagrange tets on the scalar magnetostatic path, retiring the 2.44 %
  B-field miss to 0.211 % at O(h²) (#472, #474), and on the electrostatic
  path with the adjoint retained (#608).

#### New solver physics

- 3-D electrostatic solver + Maxwell capacitance-matrix extraction (#481)
  and 3-D vector magnetostatics + inductance-matrix extraction (#512), with
  a 2-D scalar magnetostatic Poisson solver as the oracle rung (#460).
- Transient EM solver — generalized-α time integration with broadband
  S-parameters via DFT (#489); adaptive fast frequency sweep via greedy
  Galerkin PROM (#610).
- London superconductor surface BC (per-tag λ_L) on the driven and eigenmode
  paths, with ∂λ/∂λ_L via Hellmann–Feynman (#609).
- Divergence-free M-orthogonal projection for the eigen path, port-aware so
  the junction LC mode survives (#513, #515), plus a tree-cotree gauge
  module with its spectrum limitation pinned (#508).

#### Validated benchmarks

- Motor torque (Epic #448): PM magnetization sources and air-gap oracle
  (#463), Maxwell-stress + Arkkio torque extractors vs the loop T = m × B
  oracle (#464), and the driven slotless-PM locked-rotor T(θ) benchmark at
  0.71 % (#465), on multi-band annular meshes with ν heterogeneity oracles
  (#462).
- Optical fiber (Epic #339): full-vector mixed E_t–E_z Nédélec–Lagrange
  dielectric modal pencil hitting SMF-28 LP01 b within 0.88 % (≤ 1 % gate),
  with a regression tripwire for the old reduced-pencil artifact (#473,
  #477) and an audit of the ε-coupling term that pencil dropped (#461);
  analytic-cladding DtN fiber solver (#447); chromatic dispersion D(λ) + ZDW
  vs the analytic oracle (#482).
- Transmon (Epics #475/#476 groundwork): fixture ingestion + shared MSH tag
  scanners (#488, #494), Josephson junction as a lumped reactive shunt in
  the eigensolve (#496), EPR quantization + qubit parameters (#511), a
  differentiable capacitance→E_C chain (#586) driving gradient-based
  transmon-parameter optimization (#588) and island-pad shape optimization
  on the real 133k-tet mesh (#590), with harmonic mesh-morphing island
  deformation (#599).

#### New `geode-util` pre-core staging crate (Epic #414)

- Introduced `geode-util`, a pre-core staging layer above `geode-core` that
  collects shared helpers previously scattered across `geode-validation` and
  the example crates (module map `repo` / `convert` / `interop` / `fixture`
  / `viz`): fixture-repository helpers (#417), interop decoders (#418),
  edge-DOF → nodal reconstruction (#419), and the shared fixture
  TOML/pvd/sweep harness (#423). `geode-validation` now consumes these and
  retains only genuine validation-harness code, with JSON fixture
  loader/schema and serde glue migrated in Epic #429 (#434, #435, #437).

### Changed

- The workspace is fully standalone: Palace docker tooling vendored in-repo
  and all external repository references scrubbed (#542).
- Examples restructured into standalone top-level crates (mie, patch
  antenna, spiral inductor, SLCFET, waveguides, fibers; #402–#412) driven by
  the new `geode-app` clap harness with arg groups and a lifecycle seam
  (#400); example crates now depend on `geode-util` instead of
  `geode-validation`.
- Bunsen integration closed out (Epic #355): named shape contracts wired
  across the P1 gather cluster, assembly, and basis/eigensolver paths (#466,
  #467, #469) and the git pin swapped to crates.io bunsen 0.28.0 (#507).
- Assembly and factorization hot paths parallelized: rayon on the Nédélec
  host-side pattern/slot build (#538) and in faer's sparse-LU factorization
  (#521); M·v_j caching drops O(k²) reorthogonalization SpMVs (#510).
- Orchestration/authoring tooling (Loom, Anvil, Repo Skills) kept current
  across the cycle (#540, #597, #625, #662, #667, #670, #671).

### Fixed

- Transmon fixtures resolve mesh groups by name, with the real DeviceLayout
  fixture swapped in (#494).
- `geode-validation` rustdoc lints repaired and the `cargo doc -D warnings`
  gate widened to the whole workspace (#541).
- Dead macos-13 CI leg removed from cube-cavity-tolerance, ending 24 h hangs
  (#443).

### Removed

- Deleted the orphaned `examples/_support` (`geode-examples-support`) crate
  after its last consumer moved to `geode_util::viz` (Epic #414 Phase 3,
  #426, #427).
- Deleted the external-reference MoM baseline crates as part of the
  standalone move (#542).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

#### geode-core public API reorganized into a hierarchical module tree (Epic #377 — BREAKING)

- The crate's public surface, previously a flat set of root re-exports
  (`geode_core::<item>`), is now organized into directory-backed module
  groups: `backend`, `traits`, `mesh`, `elements`, `derham`, `assembly`,
  `solver`, `eigen`, `driven`, `analytic`, `postproc`, `interop`, and
  `prelude`. Every public item now lives at its canonical path
  `geode_core::<module>::<item>` (children #378–#386).
- **All deprecated flat-root re-export shims have been removed.** Code that
  imported items via `geode_core::<item>` must migrate to the canonical
  module path or `use geode_core::prelude::*;`. The only re-exports that
  remain at the crate root are the core traits
  `geode_core::{Element, Mesh, Operator}` (also available via
  `geode_core::traits::*` and the prelude).
- `silvermuller_self_consistent` has moved to `eigen::self_consistent`
  (canonical path `geode_core::eigen::self_consistent::*`), with no compat
  shim — it is a quasimode-`k` eigenpencil finder and now lives alongside
  the other eigensolvers.
- `geode_core::prelude` is finalized as the recommended ergonomic surface:
  glob-import it (`use geode_core::prelude::*;`) to pull in the high-traffic
  entry points (mesh constructors/readers, assembly/eigen/driven/analytic
  types, core traits) from their canonical paths.

This is a breaking change for downstream callers; the workspace minor
version is bumped accordingly. See epic #377 and children #378–#387.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Summary

Initial public release. GEODE-FEM is a Burn-based Rust FEM/DG electromagnetic
solver. The 0.1 milestone closes four foundational epics (#88, #193, #226,
#234) and lands a Krylov + iterative-solver sweep on top, bringing the project
to the point where the driven solver hits Palace 3D parity on a spiral
inductor benchmark and the wave-port path validates against analytic
mode-matching cross-checks.

### Added

#### Solver core (Epic #88 — Burn bring-up)

  / `cuda` / `autodiff` backends; `unsafe_code = "deny"` at the crate
  boundary.

  migration (#268).
